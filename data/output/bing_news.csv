0,"Cleft Palate Practice, Pre-Surgery","On a computer screen hovers a three-dimensional image, the face of a boy with a cleft lip and palate.
Using a mouse, a visitor to New York University's Virtual Surgery Research Laboratory can navigate through the boy's mouth, as if it were a landscape in a video game, passing under and through brightly colored layers of tissue, muscle and cartilage. Patches of transparency highlight underlying ivory bone.
The images are part of a highly accurate animated simulation of cleft lip and palate surgery that will eventually allow surgeons, medical residents and students to practice reconstructive procedures in real time, in a 3-D environment. Users will be able to mark incisions in virtual skin, draw back flaps to reveal underlying tissue layers and then manipulate these layers from different perspectives to repair a virtual cleft.
Cleft lip and cleft palate are birth defects characterized by the failure of tissue of the lip or mouth to close properly during fetal development.

2,VITAL SIGNS: CONSEQUENCES; Linking Cleft Palates and Smoking Moms,"Smoking while pregnant has long been linked to general problems like premature deliveries and babies with low birth weights, but a new study reports that it may also be linked to two specific birth defects: cleft palate and cleft lip.
Even relatively few cigarettes -- 1 to 10 a day -- may increase the chances that an infant will need surgery to repair an improperly formed mouth or lip, the researchers say. The study was reported in a recent issue of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery, the journal of the American Society of Plastic Surgeons.
Earlier studies had also suggested a link, the researchers said, but were too small to be definitive. In this case, using 1996 data from the National Center for Health Statistics, scientists compared 2,207 children born with cleft lips or palates with 4,414 children born with no congenital abnormalities.
They concluded that women who smoked up to half a pack -- 10 cigarettes -- a day had a 50 percent greater likelihood of giving birth to a child with the problem than did women who did not smoke. For women who smoked 11 to 20 cigarettes a day, the figure climbed to 55 percent, and for women who smoked more than 21 cigarettes, it was 78 percent.",2000-04-11 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,cleft lip
3,A Violent End to a Desperate Dream Leaves a Guatemalan Town Grieving,"The trek from Central America to U.S. soil has always been perilous, but a massacre with many victims from one corner of Guatemala has shaken that country.
They leave behind homes, families, everything they have known, taking their chances on a dangerous trek north toward an uncertain future, driven by poverty, lack of opportunity and the hope of something better.
For most migrants who leave Central America, like those from the municipality of Comitancillo, in the mountains of western Guatemala, the goal is to reach the United States, find work, save some money and send some back home, put down roots, maybe even find love and start a family. Usually, the biggest obstacle is crossing the increasingly fortified American border without being caught.
A group of 13 migrants who left Comitancillo in January didn’t even get the chance. Their bodies were found, along with those of six other victims, shot and burned; the corpses were piled in the back of a pickup truck that had been set on fire and abandoned in the Mexican state of Tamaulipas, just shy of the U.S. border. A dozen state police officers have been arrested in connection with the massacre.
The migrants’ remains made the return trip on Friday, March 12, each in a coffin draped with the Guatemalan flag, flown to a military airport in Guatemala City. A somber repatriation ceremony there, with an address by President Alejandro Giammattei, was shown live on national television. Relatives, friends and neighbors in Comitancillo watched the broadcast in their homes as they made final preparations for the arrival of the bodies and for the wakes and burials to follow.",2021-03-21 09:00:21,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,cleft lip
4,"Janusz Bardach, 83, Gulag Survivor and Leading Plastic Surgeon","Dr. Janusz Bardach, a plastic surgeon who improved techniques for treating cleft lip and cleft palate and who wrote an acclaimed account of his life in Soviet labor camps in the early 1940's, died on Aug. 16 in Iowa City, his home. He was 83.
Dr. Bardach, a native of Ukraine who trained in Moscow after World War II, practiced plastic surgery in Poland and headed an early program in plastic surgery there. He came to the United States in 1972 and the next year became chairman of the division of plastic and reconstructive surgery at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics in Iowa City. He also held other posts, administrative and teaching, at the university's Medical College before retiring in 1991.
Dr. Bardach developed what colleagues came to call the Bardach palatoplasty, a surgical procedure for patients with congenital clefts of the palate, a condition in which the palate is separated into halves.
The new procedure minimized scarring, entailed one operation instead of the two that had previously been required and improved the patient's speaking ability.",2002-08-31 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,cleft lip
5,Surgery on Fetuses Reveals They Heal Without Scars,"After experimenting with animals, Dr. Harrison and his colleagues began offering surgery in cases in which a human fetus was otherwise doomed. The doctors had tested such surgery on more than 1,000 sheep and 100 monkeys. They were confident that they could anesthetize a pregnant woman and her fetus, remove the fetus from the woman's uterus, operate on it, and put it back, and that the pregnancy would continue.
''Before we did that first procedure seven years ago, we had set some criteria for ourselves that are pretty important,'' Dr. Harrison said. ''It's obvious that the risk-benefit business is no problem for the fetus; he's going to die if we don't do the operation.''
''But in order to get to him, we have to put at risk an innocent bystander, the mom,'' Dr. Harrison said. ''We said we wouldn't offer fetal surgery to a family until we had proven in monkeys that you could do what you intended to do: have a good baby, have a healthy mother, have a mother who can have another child afterward, and do it with an acceptable risk.'' Urinary Tract Surgery
Dr. Harrison said fetal surgery has proved most successful for fetuses with obstructed urinary tracts. Doctors had tried to push a tube through the mother's abdomen and into the fetus to drain fetal urine, but the tubes often fell out or became clogged. Obstructed urinary tracts cause death by hindering development of lungs. Fetal urine is the main component of the amniotic fluid that bathes the fetus. Normally, the fetus ''breathes'' this fluid into its lungs. If the urinary tract is blocked, the fetus does not produce the fluid, and without it, the lungs do not develop.
Dr. Harrison has done six fetal urinary tract operations. He said it takes up to 30 minutes to operate on the fetus, and about two hours to operate on the mother. ''The moms have done fine and the kids have done fine if their problem has proven to be reversible,'' Dr. Harrison said.
Now Dr. Harrison and others are studying fetal wound-healing and the possibility of cranio-facial surgery before birth. Such surgery could correct a cleft lip, for example. One in 600 to 700 babies is born with a cleft lip. The condition can be detected before birth with ultrasound, Dr. Evans said. Babies with cleft lips usually undergo surgery after birth, but a scar remains, and the child's face does not develop properly because the scar impedes growth.
Other babies are born with inherited facial abnormalities. In Apert's syndrome, for instance, babies have high, full foreheads, flat faces and wide-spaced eyes that often tilt to the sides. These babies also often have a horizontal groove above their eyes.",1988-08-16 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,cleft lip
6,A Feel-Good Lip Balm Created in Her Dorm,"Name Zoe Mesnik-Greene
Age 23
Hometown Seattle
Now Lives Splits her time between an on-campus apartment at the University of Washington in Seattle and her cousin’s two-bedroom apartment in the Chelsea section of Manhattan.
Claim to Fame Ms. Mesnik-Greene is the founder of Lasting Smiles, an eco-friendly lip-balm company that raises funds for cleft-palate lip surgery for children in developing countries. She started the company in 2013, as a 19-year-old sophomore at Washington. “I was perusing the internet in my dorm room, and I saw a video about children born with cleft conditions,” she said. “I was so moved by the issue, I must have watched the video 10 times. I wanted to help, and that’s when it dawned on me: the connection between cleft lips and lip care.”
Big Break She developed her lip-balm formula in her dorm room with the help of YouTube tutorials, experimenting with fair-trade shea butter and coconut oil. “That’s the beauty of the internet: It levels the playing field,” she said. “I did set off the smoke alarm a few times, though.” She approached a buyer at Whole Foods at a farming event in Seattle, pitching her on the spot, and soon Whole Foods began carrying her line.
Latest Project Target started carrying Lasting Smiles in its 1,800 stores in March. “I connected with someone at Target on LinkedIn,” she said. “The next thing you know, I was flying across the country for a 30-minute meeting with their buyer.” Lasting Smiles donates 25 percent of its proceeds to cleft-palate surgeries in Peru, India and Burkina Faso, and has funded 200 operations to date.",2016-07-06 21:45:32,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,cleft lip
7,Charges of Shoddy Practices Taint Gifts of Plastic Surgery,"The charity said it has never seen the report.
Other medical volunteers echo similar concerns. While all charities want to impress donors with large numbers of operations and find it heart-wrenching to turn away patients, Operation Smile seems more concerned than others about the final tally, according to a medical volunteer who has traveled with the group and with comparable charities.
''The issue of numbers does not seem to be as significant'' with the others, according to the volunteer.
Operation Smile takes every complication ''extraordinarily seriously,'' said Dr. Magee, and the charity has made changes as a result of the incident in Beijing. For instance, team leaders overseeing anesthesia will be doctors, not nurses, and will be required to use monitoring equipment.
But Dr. Magee, who personally selects the surgeons, denied in the recent interview that the volunteer physicians, many of whom are not from the United States, were not skilled. While the Chinese saw them for only a few days, he had known them for years, he said, and ''I have no doubt about their work.''
The trouble in Beijing, however, was hardly an isolated example. In Kenya, a child died last year because the mission ran out of oxygen during the operation -- a mistake that is fatal when additional supplies of oxygen are not necessarily available. A Vietnamese child also died last year when his asthma went undetected.
In March, after Operation Smile came to Bolivia, several children needed extensive follow-up care at San Gabriel Hospital, according to Dr. Roberto Rosa, a pediatric surgeon there who was sharply critical of Operation Smile and other charities. In one case, the technique used on a little girl was clearly inappropriate, he said.
''This is a form of neo-colonialism,'' argued Dr. Rosa, who said his hospital had performed about 2,000 of these surgeries. While his hospital would be eager to cooperate with surgeons from the United States, Operation Smile had committed ''surgical safaris against our children,'' who are from poor families who are unlikely to complain, he said.",1999-11-24 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,cleft lip
8,"An Unlikely Sex Symbol, Poised for a Breakthrough","He has only a few more lines in “Transit,” a time-jumbling modern-day adaptation of a novel about World War II, in which he plays a refugee trying to get exit papers to escape a coming invasion. In an email, Mr. Petzold, who also directed “Barbara” and “Phoenix,” described Mr. Rogowski as a “great actor” who is able to balance “sadness and confidence, coldness and empathy” like “a dancer.”
Anja Dihrberg, a veteran German casting director, helped cast Mr. Rogowski in Terrence Malick’s upcoming World War II film “Radegund.” She said by phone that Mr. Rogowski stood out in Germany for his physical performance, which she believed might be a lucky side effect of his speech impediment: The vast majority of German actors focus on being able to recite large amounts of text, she said, “but he is the exception.”
“You can lose yourself in Franz’s face and eyes,” Ms. Dihrberg added.
Mr. Rogowski said he was not allowed to reveal his role in “Radegund,” which tells the true story of Franz Jägerstätter, an Austrian conscientious objector, but Ms. Dihrberg described it as “a figure that is required to suffer.” She said that Mr. Malick was intent on overcoming scheduling conflicts to secure Mr. Rogowski’s participation. “We did everything we could to make it possible for him to play that role, because of Mr. Malick,” she said. “Terrence fought for him.”
Growing up in the university town of Tübingen, in southern Germany, Mr. Rogowski was bullied for his lisp and performed poorly in school, the result of what he said was an undiagnosed attention disorder. He also clashed with his mother, he said, because of an excessive pot-smoking habit. At 16, he left school and moved in with a friend.",2018-05-02 10:00:15,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,cleft lip
9,Ultrasound and Fury: One Mother's Ordeal,"They also criticize the skills of those who did the scans in the study, complaining that too many birth defects were missed and thus many chances to make a difference in outcome were likewise missed. For example, if a fetus is found to have gastroschisis, in which the bowels protrude through a hole in the abdomen, the newborn has a much better chance of surviving and thriving if it is delivered in the same hospital where the corrective surgery will be performed, rather than having to being moved.
But Dr. Ewigman and others respond that such defects are too rare to justify automatic screening policies, and that the happy stories are more than countered by drawbacks. False positives like mine are said to be very rare, yet without trying I learned of three other women whose fetuses were incorrectly diagnosed as having clubfeet. And while these mistakes were joyfully resolved, false positives can have devastating outcomes. Dr. Horger cited the case of a woman who received an ultrasound diagnosis that her fetus had no kidneys, a fatal condition. She aborted the fetus at 18 weeks, and an autopsy revealed apparently normal kidneys.
More often women receive murky results that are difficult to interpret, but that offer just enough substance to nourish anxiety. During several scans performed in her third pregnancy, a neighbor of mine was told that her baby might have a serious kidney defect. There was nothing to do but wait and worry. Months later, she gave birth to a healthy daughter. Another acquaintance, who is still pregnant, was told after a sonogram that her fetus's eyes were unusually close together. She asked her doctors what it meant and what she should do about it. They did not know, and they suggested more scans. She refused. ''So maybe the baby will look like Lyle Lovett,'' she said, maintaining her humor but clearly worried.
Dr. Sheryl Burt Ruzek, a professor of health education at Temple University, said the rampant use of ultrasound ''has created false expectations that by having repeated screenings we can improve the likelihood of a good outcome of pregnancy.'' It gives the illusion of perfectability, but like most medical assays, ultrasound is imperfect. It can find problems where none exist, and, more often, it misses defects that exist. More than half of all defects have been shown to go unnoticed by ultrasound. ''The search for the perfect child is making women very anxious about reproducing,'' Dr. Ruzek said. An unfortunate byproduct of expecting perfection is the urge to sue upon arrival of an imperfect baby. Dr. Horger said one of the commonest causes of obstetrical lawsuits is the failure of a doctor to pick up a birth defect on ultrasound. Although the Radius study indicates that early detection of most abnormalities does not do much good anyway, doctors end up screening just to cover their afts.
A particular problem with ultrasound is that while women know that amniocentesis and most prenatal tests are designed to look for defects, they approach their sonogram with optimism. ''They're persuaded they'll be reassured, and will get their first picture of the baby,'' said Dr. Gail Geller, a bioethicist at Johns Hopkins University. ''But the physician's training is to find something that might be wrong. There's a cognitive dissonance between practitioners and patients.'' Indeed, she said, ''physicians can sound almost excited when they find something.'' That happened to us, with the doctor who murmured appreciatively, ''Good catch.''
In the end, many researchers said that women should be entitled to have ultrasound and other prenatal tests, but that the process of informed consent must be taken far more seriously than it currently is. Women should be told in detail of the limitations of screening, and of the fact that clinical studies show no benefit to scanning during a normal pregnancy, Dr. Geller said. Nor is it clear that doctors should bother ferreting out every minor aberration -- every cleft lip, every excess finger.
We still do not know why our daughter's foot appeared clubbed on three sonograms when it was not. The ultrasound specialists who gave us the final, definitive diagnosis said they stood by their original call and suggested the foot may have corrected itself during the later stages of pregnancy.
I am skeptical. I think this is a case of ambiguity prematurely corseted into certainty, and of insufficient data on all the possible variations of a normal fetal foot (not to mention any other body part) at 20 weeks gestation. I think my child has inherited her mother's unusually supple feet, which can point and twist in many directions and even mimic a clublike contortion. Perhaps my daughter was dreaming that she was a ballerina, flexing her foot into en pointe position, and preparing to dance the dance.",1996-11-26 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,cleft lip

11,CLEFT PALATE TIED TO DEFECTIVE GENE,"Scientists have linked a rare form of cleft palate to a defective gene, a finding that could help lead to better understanding of another birth defect, spina bifida, a researcher has reported.
A study of genes from 82 members of a family in Iceland, of whom 21 had cleft palate or a related birth defect, showed that the faulty gene lies on a portion of the X chromosome, said the researcher, Dr. Gudrun Moore.
Dr. Moore and colleagues reported the finding in the Thursday issue of the British journal Nature.
Dr. Moore, a member of the biochemistry department at St. Mary's Hospital Medical School at the University of London, said she hoped the gene could be isolated and identified within six months. Once the gene is studied, scientists should get a clue into what goes wrong to produce cleft palate, she said in a telephone interview. Tissues Fail to Fuse
Since cleft palate and spina bifida, a spine defect, both involve failure of particular tissues to fuse in an embryo, she added, the conditions may share some underlying causes. Some cases of spina bifida are also linked to the X chromosome, and further study of them may shed light on any similarities, she said.",1987-03-05 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,cleft palate
12,SCIENCE WATCH; STUDY HINTS CLEFT PALATE CAN BE CURED IN WOMB,"AN Irish scientist, investigating how cleft palate might be cured or prevented in humans before birth, has reported success in experiments with alligator fetuses. The findings are significant because the mouths and jaw structures of alligators are similar to those of humans.
Cleft palate, which affects about one of every 800 newborns, can cause speech and swallowing difficulties if not corrected. The defect has long been thought to be primarily caused by a genetic aberration, though its development in the fetal stage may also depend on external factors in pregnancy.
The scientist, Mark Ferguson, an anatomist at Queen's University in Belfast, Northern Ireland, traveled to Louisiana to gather eggs and catch young alligators. He transported the eggs and baby reptiles to the Laboratory for Developmental Biology at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles for his research. There he found that it was possible, by working through windows cut in the eggshells, to surgically correct the handicap in unborn alligators.
Dr. Ferguson, an expert on cleft palate, published his findings in the Jan. 16 issue of the American Dental Association's news journal. In the report, he said such procedures resulted in no sign of scarring when the reptiles reached full term and were born. This was in contrast to the effects of similar surgery on human adults, which resulted in leaving a scar. ''This holds out hope that at some point in the future the technique might be applied to human babies,'' he said.",1984-02-07 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,cleft palate

17,Whirlwind of Facial Surgery By Foreigners Upsets China,"Operation Smile said it had not seen the report.
''We have a long, long history in China in many, many sites,'' said Dr. Magee, who said he had not heard of any meeting or any recommendations.
The Operation
Low-Risk Procedure Still Leads to Death
Cleft lips and palate deformities are relatively common in China, especially in the countryside, where the condition may result from the marriage of close relatives as well as pollution, doctors say. A cleft lip or palate is rarely life-threatening and corrective surgery is generally considered elective -- though it can greatly improve a child's appearance and speech.
Risks associated with the surgery are low, but do exist. ''In the United States, it's extremely uncommon to lose a child, for a child to die, from cleft lip or palate surgery,'' said Dr. Marilyn Jones, the president of the American Cleft Palate-Craniofacial Association.
But Operation Smile has had 16 deaths since it began operations in 1982, three of them in China. The child in Beijing died just after anesthesia was applied without proper monitoring. In the mid-90's, two children died during a mission in Shantou in southern China, Dr. Li Yu, a surgeon at the university hospital there, reported.
The Plastic Surgery Hospital in Beijing had never had a child die during cleft lip or palate surgery until Operation Smile, doctors there said. The hospital's staff was shaken by a procedural error: Although the hospital requires the use of its modern equipment to monitor anesthesia during surgery, Operation Smile volunteers decided not to use it.
''When we saw American-trained anesthesiologists using these primitive methods, our impression was that they must have developed these methods for use in remote rural areas,'' the professor of anesthesia at the hospital said. ''We would never use them here, and my guess is that they would never be used at an American hospital.''
The professor said it is still not clear what killed the 3-year-old boy, from rural Shanxi province, but he said that the child's heart was normal and that he suspected an anesthesia overdose. He added that whatever the cause, a modern monitoring system would have detected the problem long before the child went into cardiac arrest.",1999-11-25 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,cleft palate

20,HERPES NOW BLAMED FOR MORE ILLNESS THAN ANY OTHER HUMAN VIRUSES,"''Each year, another half million cases of genital herpes are added to the 20-odd million already infected,'' notes Dr. Fred Rapp, a microbiologist at Hershey Medical School and a leading herpes investigator. ''We will soon have 30 million cases, and the chances of getting infected by an occasional sexual partner keep increasing.''
According to Dr. Rapp, other characteristics responsible for the increased notoriety of herpes viruses and the difficulties researchers have in combating them include the following:
- All the herpes viruses can hide out in the body, apparently for life. At least three - the cold sore, genital herpes and chicken pox viruses - can re-emerge to cause recurrent infections.
- Although the first effective antiviral drug was developed against a herpes virus, there is still no cure for human herpes and no treatment can eradicate hidden infections or prevent their recurrence. Treatment can ward off herpes-caused blindness and potentially deadly encephalitis, but in the latter case, the treatment itself can have devastating side effects.
- All five human herpes viruses have been shown in the laboratory to transform normal human cells into cancer cells, though proof that the viruses actually cause cancer in people is still indefinite. Two nonhuman herpes viruses are already established causes of cancer in animals: Marek's disease, a lymphoma of chickens, and kidney cancer in leopard frogs. In addition to cervical cancer, in people herpes viruses are suspected causes of Burkitt's lymphoma, nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and possibly also vulvar cancer, Kaposi's sarcoma (which occurs primarily among homosexual men) and cancer of the prostate and bladder.
- Pieces of genetic material from genital herpes virus have been found in cancer cells of 40 to 50 percent of patients with cervical cancer, Dr. Rapp said. One study showed that women who married men whose first wives had cervical cancer themselves faced a three-tofour-times increased risk of developing the disease.
- Vaccines, which stimulate the production of antibodies to fight off infectious organisms, may not block latent or recurrent herpes or prevent herpes-triggered cancers. Recurrent infection and herpesassociated cancers occur in people who are loaded with antibodies, which may keep the virus from causing a body-wide attack, but cannot prevent recurring herpes lesions. Nor would they keep the virus from transforming cells to cancer.
However, a successful vaccine was developed against Marek's disease of chickens, raising the hope that similar preventives might ward off initial infections with human herpes viruses.
When the virus invades a cell, it sheds its outer layer, allowing viral genes to take over the cell's genetic machinery and turn it into a virus factory. The herpes viruses are structurally very similar, but most differ widely in genetic makeup. Only the two herpes simplex viruses share a large percentage of genes.
''The herpes viruses are genetically the most complex human viruses we have left to deal with,'' Dr. Rapp said. Yet only a small amount of viral genetic information - probably less than 3 percent of the total in a herpes virus - is needed to transform cells and maintain their cancerous state, Dr. Rapp has reported. Researchers working on herpes vaccines must be certain that the viral material used in the vaccine cannot itself transform cells to cancer. The usual vaccines made from modified live viruses probably could not be used against potentially cancer-causing herpes viruses.",1982-05-04 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,herpes
21,"Gel Cuts Herpes Risk in Women, Study Finds","A vaginal gel that sharply reduces a woman’s risk of infection with the AIDS virus is even more effective against genital herpes, a much more common risk for young American women, a new study has found.
The study, by researchers from the National Institutes of Health, Gilead Sciences Inc. and universities in Belgium and Italy, suggests that the microbicide gel, which was originally developed to fight AIDS in Africa, could lower the incidence of herpes in many women.
“This could be incredibly helpful,” said Dr. Jeanne Marrazzo, a herpes expert from the University of Washington’s medical school. “Protection that a woman can control is the holy grail in this field. It’s hard for me to believe that something that protects against both H.I.V. and herpes wouldn’t be appealing to a lot of young American women.”
An executive at Gilead, the company that makes tenofovir, the anti-AIDS drug that is the gel’s active ingredient, said the company was debating whether to spend the millions of dollars needed to get the gel approved for the American market. Even if the company pressed ahead immediately, “it would be three to four years before we were ready to submit data” to the Food and Drug Administration, Norbert W. Bischofberger, Gilead’s chief scientific officer, said.",2011-10-21 00:02:06,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,herpes
22,Personal Health; Genital herpes thrives on ignorance and secrecy.,"Type 1 herpes usually causes cold sores, and type 2 usually causes genital herpes, but the types overlap, and the genital infection can be acquired through oral sex with a partner who has a herpes outbreak on the mouth.
Experts say that to reduce the risk of spreading genital herpes, people with known active infections should practice abstinence until their sores are completely healed and use protective measures during sexual activity at all other times. The protective measures are the use of latex condoms along with a spermicidal jelly or cream, which can inactivate the herpes virus as well as other organisms that cause venereal disease.
But there are no guarantees. Having intimate contact with someone who has had genital herpes, even if the outbreak occurred years ago and never recurred, always carries some risk of acquiring the infection. But someone who acquires the virus from an infected partner may not develop herpes sores, even though he or she could pass the infection along to someone else. One person in 10 who has a first outbreak never has a recurrence. High Emotional Toll
The young woman who wrote to The Times is hardly alone in her feelings of desperation and social inhibition. A survey conducted last July by the American Social Health Association among 5,000 men and women infected by herpes revealed that even years after the first attack, feelings of isolation and depression are commonplace. More than half of the 62 percent who responded to the survey reported feeling depressed, and an equal number said they feared rejection in social situations.
With time, the impact of herpes on work and school performance and nonsexual social pleasure diminished. But the respondents continued to be distressed about sexual issues. Forty-four percent said they thought that herpes diminished their desirability and 48 percent said it interfered with establishing new relationships.
The survey respondents also gave poor marks to the physicians they had initially consulted about herpes. Sixty-four percent said the doctors had failed to deal appropriately with the emotional issues related to their infection.
While there is no cure for a herpes infection, the severity and duration of an attack can be reduced by an antiviral drug, acyclovir, if it is taken during the initial outbreak for 10 days or at the first signs of a recurrence for five days. The drug is usually taken orally five times a day. Various treatments may also be applied directly to the affected area to relieve discomfort and speed healing.",1992-08-12 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,herpes
23,TREATMENT FOUND TO PREVENT FLAREUP OF HERPES SYMPTOMS,"Genital herpes has already afflicted perhaps 10 percent of the American population, or some 20 million people, and it is spreading to another 300,000 to 500,000 additional victims each year, Dr. Straus said. Most victims suffer small, painful genital blisters, often accompanied by swelling and flulike symptoms. The initial symptoms generally disappear within three weeks, but the herpes virus then retreats into the nerve roots and re-emerges periodically to cause other flareups.
The typical victim suffers three or four such flareups each year, Dr. Straus said, but those most severely afflicted may experience 12 to 16 recurrences a year, a rate that often destroys social and marital relations, disrupts job performance, and causes depression in many individuals.
The new treatment is expected to be of greatest value to those who have ''very severe cases'' of herpes involving very frequent recurrences, Dr. Straus said. Such individuals account for perhaps 2 percent to 5 percent of all herpes victims, he added, stressing that the figures were a rough estimate.
The Food and Drug Administration is in the final stages of evaluating the use of short-term, oral doses of the drug for treating outbreaks of herpes and may grant approval before the end of the year. But agency spokesmen said they had not yet been asked to approve the use of the drug on a sustained daily basis to prevent recurrences of herpes symptoms.
Two studies on the effectiveness of the acyclovir treatments in suppressing recurrences of herpes symptoms were published in the June 14 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine and presented at the news conference here.",1984-06-14 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,herpes
24,THE SEARCH FOR HERPES DRUGS,"The herpes I virus typically burrows deep into nerve cells near the brain, while herpes II invades the spinal cord, both lying dormant between periodic eruptions.
Laurence Corry, a Seattle physician who is conducting the nation's first large-scale test on human patients of a herpes vaccine made by Merck & Company, said that several drugs under development ''are clearly promising.''
However, he declined to speculate on when any of these drugs might receive the approval of the Food and Drug Administration and be brought to market. ''I don't expect a cure,'' Dr. Corry said, adding that a variety of ''very separate drugs'' are more likely to be produced that would protect users from contracting the disease, prevent transmission and reduce the frequency of skin lesions. The Research
Currently, the research falls largely into three categories: efforts to find a vaccine that would immunize people against herpes; work on treatments for infected patients, and diagnostic procedures that would speed identification of the virus. In some cases, this research involves advanced genetic engineering technology, in which human protein is manufactured outside the body.
The only herpes drug that has so far cleared the Federal Government's regulatory procedures is acyclovir, which was brought to market in March 1982 by Burroughs, the United States subsidiary of the Wellcome Foundation Ltd., a British company. The drug, sold under the trade name of Zorivax, is an ointment designed to reduce the duration of a patient's first genital herpes infection, which normally lasts two to three weeks.
Medical experts maintain that the drug is of limited value to most patients because it does not prevent recurrences. Burroughs estimated that acyclovir generated about $17 million in sales during its first year.
The company said it hoped to receive Government approval by the end of the year to introduce an oral form of the same drug. Work on Interferon",1983-05-26 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,herpes
25,‘Viruses of love’,"The viral invasion is met first by white blood cells, which engulf the dying cells and limit the blister's size. At the same time, the liver, spleen and superficial lymph nodes begin production of the immune system's most sophisticated killers, antibodies. Unlike the primitive white cells, which
William A. Knaus, M.D. is an internist at the George Washington University Medical Center in Washington. D.C. automatically attack all intruding microbes, antibodies respond to only one specific bacteria or virus. They are able to recognize the foreign organism, or antigen, and instantly lock onto it like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle. Antibody attachment begins a series of physical and biochemical events that eventually leads to the death of the viral intruder.
Despite this violent cellular and immunologic reaction, the initial viral invasion often goes unnoticed by the human. The first blister may form in the back of the mouth, where it is undetected, or the virus may simplybe introduced without causing any clear symptoms. Unfortunately, noticed or not, initial contact with the virus has more obvious future implications.
Thousands of the viruses formed from the original invader are carried by the circulatory system to other parts of the body. Although cold sores seldom develop at other places, herpes viruses have developed the same affinity for the nervous system as the viruses causing polio and rabies. The circulating herpes replicas quickly penetrate the body's nerve cells where they may reside for many years. During autopsies, pieces of herpes type I have been found in the nerve‐cell center that sends branches to our lips and mouth—the trigeminal ganglion—and type 2 has been recovered from the sacral nerves, which innervate the genitalia.
Instead of attacking the nerve cell, the herpes virus merely waits there. Any of several events apparently can trigger its release: emotional or physical stress, hormonal changes coincident with menstruation, or the biochemical upheaval of puberty. The virus leaves the nerve‐cell nucleus and enters the skin where it produces a tingling, burning sensation and, a day or two later, a cold sore.
Perhaps the most dramatic instance of herpes's affinity for the nervous system is the painful disease known as shingles. The viral culprit is yet another member of the family, herpes varicella, or chicken‐pox virus. This virus not only causes chicken pox; it sometimes takes up residence inside the cells of the spinal nerves. When it enters the skin, the virus produces a linear eruption of blisters that slowly and precisely creeps along the path of the spinal nerves. In fact, the herpes family got its name from the Greek word meaning crawl or creep.
One of the virus's still unsolved mysteries is how it can continue to cause infection in the face of the high levels of antibody it stimulates. Since 90 percent of the world's population is exposed to herpes type I, and thus develops these antibodies at one time or another, why is infection with herpes such a common problem? The answer may lie in the virus's ability to avoid direct contact with the protective antibodies. Once inside a cell, herpes seldom exposes itself to the blood. It waits until a neighboring cell makes contact before it extends its territory. Researchers working with the electron microscope have demonstrated unique tunnels through which the virus can pass protected and untouched from cell to cell.",1976-10-17 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,herpes
26,A Deadly Virus Alarms the Equestrian World,"Shortly after arriving from abroad last month, Dr. Kent Allen’s new patient spiked a low fever. The doctor inserted a sterile swab into his patient’s nostril, a P.C.R. test to determine if this was yet another case of a potentially deadly virus sweeping the globe.
Then the patient went back to eating his hay.
The gray Irish Sport Horse, named McCoy, tested negative for an illness currently devastating European equestrian sports. An outbreak of a neurological form of the common equine herpes virus has killed nearly 20 horses and sickened over 100 more. It has forced the shutdown of competitions across 10 European countries.
With eerie echoes of the human coronavirus and the current pandemic, the virulent equine virus, which can kill a horse in less than 24 hours, has raced through the sport horse industry at a time when experts say it can least afford it: The shutdowns to stop the spread of the virus, known as E.H.V., come after nearly a year of shutdowns in the face of Covid-19. The coronavirus closed barns and canceled international championships, including last year’s World Cup Finals for dressage and show jumping, an important Olympic proving ground.

27,What to Know About Sexually Transmitted Infections and Pregnancy,"Get tested at the start of your pregnancy.
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend that pregnant patients under the age of 25 and those who are at a higher risk for S.T.I.s get tested for chlamydia, gonorrhea, hepatitis B, H.I.V. and syphilis. Your doctor may call for an S.T.I. panel even if you’re not at high risk.
If left untreated, some of these S.T.I.s can cause complications like preterm labor or low birth weight in the baby. Some can also be transmitted from mother to child if left untreated, or without the proper precautions, but most S.T.I.s can be treated without any risk to the fetus.
Your obstetrician should be the one to ask you about your sexual history and determine what S.T.I.s you should get tested for, but often ob-gyns don’t ask.
“A lot of health providers are really uncomfortable asking patients about their sexual history,” said Dr. Holly Fontenot, Ph.D., an associate professor at the William F. Connell School of Nursing at Boston College. “It becomes a little more complicated when you’re pregnant because people perceive you’re with this one mutual partner with whom you planned this pregnancy and are in this committed, monogamous relationship.”
It can be uncomfortable, but being totally open and honest with your health care provider about your sexual practices, history and partners will help determine your risk for S.T.I.s. Your practitioner should know:
If you or your partner have multiple sex partners
The S.T.I. status of your partner(s)
Your typical condom usage
If you use any drugs, especially intravenous ones
If you have had an S.T.I. before
If you or your partner are under 25
If you have a bacterial infection …
The common bacterial S.T.I.s include chlamydia, gonorrhea and syphilis. If you test positive for one of these S.T.I.s, your doctor will put you on a course of antibiotics and then test again to be sure the infection is gone. The antibiotics will not affect the fetus.",2020-04-17 22:15:24,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,herpes
28,"For Some Patients, Shingles Is Just the Beginning","Correction Appended
For William Thompson, a retired builder from Hampton, N.H., the problem began with a rash that appeared on his back one Sunday morning about two years ago. ""I thought it was from soap or detergent or something,"" he recalled.
But his back began to pain him, and soon he was in agony almost all the time. ""I could not sit down, I could not stand up,"" Mr. Thompson, 68, said in an interview. ""I had pain everywhere, just everywhere.""
He spent almost every moment lying down, he said, and in two months he left his house only four times, to visit the doctor.
""I can admit it,"" he said. ""Suicide looked like a pretty good option.""
Mr. Thompson's rash was the onset of shingles, a painful nerve disorder that occurs when the chickenpox virus, after lurking in the body for decades, comes back to life. In most cases, shingles passes after a highly unpleasant week or two. But sometimes, as with Mr. Thompson, there is persistent nerve damage and pain, an aftereffect called postherpetic neuralgia or PHN.

29,"Hunting a Killer: Sex, Drugs and the Return of Syphilis","OKLAHOMA CITY — For months, health officials in this socially conservative state capital have been staggered by a fast-spreading outbreak of a disease that, for nearly two decades, was considered all but extinguished.
Syphilis, the deadly sexually transmitted infection that can lead to blindness, paralysis and dementia, is returning here and around the country, another consequence of the heroin and methamphetamine epidemics, as users trade sex for drugs.
To locate possible patients and draw their blood for testing, Oklahoma’s syphilis detectives have been knocking on doors in dilapidated apartment complexes and dingy motels, driving down lonely rural roads and interviewing prison inmates. Syphilis has led them to members of 17 gangs; to drug dealers; to prostitutes, pimps and johns; and to their spouses and lovers, all caught in the disease’s undertow.
“Syphilis doesn’t sleep for anyone,” said Portia King, a veteran Oklahoma state health investigator. “We have 200 open cases of sex partners we’re looking for. And the spread is migrating out of the city.”",2017-08-24 09:00:27,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,herpes
30,"Mumps Makes a Comeback, Even Among the Vaccinated","Other strategies to contain the outbreak on campus included education about cough hygiene (for instance, cough into your arm or a tissue), and working with student health services to make it possible for infectious students to isolate themselves, arranging for them to miss classes and retake tests so there was no pressure to break isolation, setting up food delivery services, and providing masks for those who had to use communal bathrooms.
Even if the immunity has dwindled, “we know that two doses of M.M.R. decreases your risk of serious complications,” Dr. Routh said. An important rationale for vaccinating against mumps was always to protect against orchitis, an inflammation of the testicles which used to be relatively common in post-pubertal males who came down with mumps, affecting 20 to 30 percent of them, and sometimes leaving them with loss of testicular tissue, decreased sperm counts and concerns about future fertility. The rate was much lower in vaccinated young adults.
Mumps virus can also more rarely cause inflammation of the ovaries, and even more rarely, though more dangerously, deafness and inflammation of the brain; again, these complications appear to be even rarer in those who have been vaccinated, but they may still occur. And even with 6,000 cases, it can be hard to estimate the frequency of a complication like lasting deafness, which used to occur in about one in every 20,000 cases.
Of course, waning immunity can be a problem after college as well. Dr. Alan Lucerna, the program director for combined emergency and internal medicine at Rowan School of Osteopathic Medicine in New Jersey, reported in February 2017 on a case of mumps in a fully immunized adult, in an article titled “Still a pain in the neck after all this time.”
“A good number of patients who come to the E.R. and are subsequently diagnosed with mumps are vaccinated and come in thinking it was just a lymph node swelling,” Dr. Lucerna said. Adults who develop swelling at the angle of the jaw together with flulike symptoms should think about mumps, he said. “We probably underdiagnose it.”
Should parents worry about sending their children off to college with their two childhood doses of mumps vaccine? “No, we do know that two doses of vaccine is protective,” Dr. Routh said. The current recommendation is that a third dose, while safe, is only warranted for people felt to be at high risk by public health workers, like the Iowa students in the setting of an outbreak. The two childhood doses of M.M.R. do protect most people against getting mumps, and they also, of course protect against measles, a much more serious disease, not to mention rubella.
“We’ve heard some people say this proves the vaccine’s not working, but the vaccine probably prevented a lot more students from getting ill,” Dr. Quinlisk said. Immunity does not wane in everyone, so many people who are exposed don’t get sick. “We certainly commend the University of Iowa for having a mandatory vaccine policy which kept it from being worse and prevented complications.”
Parents might want to keep in mind the informal survey done at the Iowa vaccine clinics where students waiting to get their third M.M.R.s were asked why they had come: Were they motivated by the posters on campus bulletin boards or by fear of complications?
“The No. 1 answer by far was: My mother called me and told me to,” Dr. Quinlisk said. “So the emails that went out to parents had a significant impact, and we have told other college campuses to make sure they don’t forget to keep the parents in the loop.”",2017-11-06 11:00:02,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,mumps
31,Mumps Is On the Rise. A Waning Vaccine Response May Be Why.,"Mumps is resurging. And it may be because the immune response provoked by the mumps vaccine weakens significantly over time, and not because people are avoiding vaccination or because the virus has evolved to develop immunity to the vaccine, a new study has found.
The mumps resurgence has been largely in people 18 to 29, most of whom received the recommended two shots in early childhood, and not in older people who gained immunity through natural infection before the vaccine was developed.
Using data from epidemiological studies and mathematical models, researchers found that the ongoing resurgence, which began in 2006, has left about a third of children 10 to 14 at risk. The researchers estimate that about 25 percent of vaccinated people will lose their immunity in 8 years, 50 percent in 19 years, and 75 percent in 38 years. The study is in Science Translational Medicine.
“We’ve seen the outbreaks of mumps in vaccinated populations,” said the lead author, Joseph A. Lewnard, a research associate at the Harvard T.H.

The outbreak originated at an all-boys religious camp in Sullivan County in June and has spread through the tightly knit Orthodox Jewish communities in Williamsburg, Crown Heights and Borough Park, city officials said. Only 3 percent of the cases in the outbreak have been reported outside Orthodox communities, health officials said.
There have also been cases in Orange and Rockland Counties, in Ocean County and surrounding areas in New Jersey and in Quebec, health officials said.
Most of those infected are boys from 7 to 18 years old, according to a federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report released Thursday.",2010-02-12 03:03:34,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,mumps

We have provided our clubs with best practices and steps that should be employed to minimize exposure and risk. We hope and believe it is just a matter of time until the situation resolves.”
According to the C.D.C., the United States has experienced a few hundred mumps cases each year since 2000, with the most having occurred in 2006, when 6,500 cases were reported, predominantly on college campuses. From Jan. 1 to Nov. 29 this year, the C.D.C. reported 1,078 mumps cases. Before vaccinations became widespread in 1967, about 186,000 mumps cases were reported each year.
The N.H.L. has been conferring with the C.D.C. and last month sent out guidelines for hygiene and urged teams to screen and vaccinate players.
“The N.H.L.’s best strategy is to ensure that everyone is up to date with their vaccinations,” Fiebelkorn said.
But the vaccine is not 100 percent effective. The Penguins said that Crosby had received a mumps booster shot before leaving for the Olympics in Sochi, Russia, in February, and another immunization two weeks ago along with the rest of the team. Recent testing recommended by the N.H.L. showed that Crosby was not susceptible to the virus. (Two other Olympians, the Ducks’ Corey Perry and the Wild’s Ryan Suter, have been among the afflicted.)
On Friday, Crosby practiced and spoke to the news media with one side of his face swollen, a possible sign of infection. But initial tests for mumps showed negative results, the Penguins said.
“The mumps component of the M.M.R. vaccine is pretty effective,” Fiebelkorn said. “Generally, we say that one dose is about 80 percent effective, and two doses is about 90 percent effective. But there is no vaccine that’s 100 percent effective. There is some margin for fully vaccinated individuals to still be infected with mumps if they’re exposed to the virus.”",2014-12-16 01:46:35,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,mumps
34,Mumps Epidemic Spreads; More Vaccine Promised,"About half of the cases in Iowa involve college-age students, most of whom have been vaccinated, said the state epidemiologist, Dr. Patricia Quinlisk. Federal and state health investigators have not pinpointed the origin of the epidemic, but the first cases were identified in December on a college campus in either Iowa City or Dubuque. State officials said they would not name the campus because such information was medically privileged.
Dr. Gerberding said the disease had spread quickly because of the dense concentration of students in affected cities and because the vaccine is not perfect. It has about an 80 percent efficacy rate for people who have been inoculated with one dose, and a rate of about 90 percent for people who have received the recommended two doses.
""We have absolutely no information to suggest that there's a problem with the vaccine,"" Dr. Gerberding said. ""What's going on here is basically a number of people who haven't received both doses, coupled together with people who have received the vaccine but are susceptible anyway, living in crowded conditions like college dormitories or mixing up with other students at spring break or during holidays, and setting up a cascade of transmission that's going to take a while to curtail.""
In recent years there have been 250 to 300 mumps cases annually in the United States, said Dr. Jane Seward, acting deputy director of the division of viral diseases for the C.D.C. The last significant outbreak was in 1989, when Kansas had 269 cases. This time, the states with the most cases, after Iowa, are Kansas, Illinois and Nebraska.

35,"NEW STUDY LINKS MUMPS, DIABETES","Mumps, according to the researchers is a “slow virus” that can be harbored in the pancreas for up to four years. Thus, the causal effect is not seen until several years later, the doctor said.
From these data, the group was able to offer a theory for the high incidence of diabetes in boys that occurred between 1950 and 1960. The researchers believe that the increase was related to the widespread practice at the time of exposing preadolescent boys to mumps. This practice was followed to reduce the risk of sterility, which is believed to result if the disease is contracted after puberty.
Dr. Sultz said that one of the possible future routes of exploration was the development of a mumps vaccine made of dead virus rather than the live virus.
‘Little Bit of Disease’
“Mumps vaccine gives a person a little bit of the disease to give him immunity. We are suggesting that a little bit of disease in this case might be too much,” he said, adding that he did not want to frighten mothers away from having their children immunized.
In addition to Dr. Sultz, the investigators were Dr. Benjamin A. Hart, Dr. Maria Zielezny and the late Dr. Edward R. Schlesinger, who worked at the University of Pittsburgh.
The New Jersey study of sexual transmission of hepatitis was a chance finding by Dr. Martin Goldfield, an assistant commissioner of health for New Jersey who was looking for a more careful documentation of drug addiction and its attendant risk of hepatitis infection from dirty hypodermic needles.
Dr. Goldfield said the medical histories of 140 families in which one adult member was known to have had hepatitis were reviewed.

36,"Maurice Hilleman, M.M.R. Vaccine’s Forgotten Hero","Dr. Hilleman then went on to refine the vaccine over the next four years, eventually producing the much safer Moraten strain that is still in use today. As always, he kept himself in the background: The name stands for “more attenuated enders.”
One other crucial event in the development of M.M.R. happened that spring of 1963: An epidemic of rubella began in Europe and quickly swept around the globe. In this country, the virus’s devastating effect on first-trimester pregnancies caused about 11,000 newborns to die, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. An additional 20,000 suffered birth defects, including deafness, heart disease and cataracts.
Dr. Hilleman was already testing his own vaccine as the epidemic ended in 1965. But he agreed to work instead with a vaccine being developed by federal regulators. It was, he later recalled, “toxic, toxic, toxic.” By 1969, he had cleaned it up enough to obtain F.D.A. approval and prevent another rubella epidemic. Finally, in 1971, he put his vaccines for measles, mumps and rubella together to make M.M.R., replacing a series of six shots with just two.
Or rather not finally. In 1978, having found a better rubella vaccine than his own, Dr. Hilleman asked its developer if he could use it in the M.M.R. The developer, Dr. Stanley Plotkin, then of the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia, was momentarily speechless. It was an expensive choice for Merck, and might have been a painful one for anyone other than Dr. Hilleman.
“It’s not that he didn’t have an ego. He certainly did,” Dr. Plotkin recalled in a recent interview. “But he valued excellence above that. Once he decided that this strain was better, he did what he had to do,” even if it meant sacrificing his own work.
Given Dr. Hilleman’s obsession with safety and effectiveness, it came as a bitter surprise toward the end of his life when his vaccine was at the center of what Dr. Offit called “a perfect storm of fear.” In 1998, The Lancet, a respected British medical journal, published an article alleging that M.M.R. had caused an epidemic of autism.
The lead author, Dr. Andrew Wakefield, became a media celebrity, and some parents began to balk at having their children immunized; the vaccine’s very success had made them forget just how devastating measles, mumps and rubella could be. Dr. Hilleman, who might reasonably have been expected to win a Nobel Prize, got hate mail and death threats instead.",2013-05-06 18:39:52,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,mumps

Actually, the kids have known each other for so long that they have all become habituated to each other, the girls and the fellows. Some of the fellows have girl friends who are not members of the and they seldom hang out with the group.
It seems only natural for the group and this building to be in this block, which like so many others in New York City, has several distinctive aspects. To begin with, the block, like the building and the group, has also been abandoned—by city officials. This block is exceptionally narrow, even for a “Big Apple” side street. Fights are frequently caused by the fact that if a Volkswagen double parks in the block, a bicycle has trouble passing through. Every year for the past 10 years, with the possible exception of 1973, a child has been killed in the street by an automobile, in, this block. Parents grieve and protest and participate in near‐lynchings of careless drivers, but still there are no traffic signs. My mistake. There is one sign at one end; it says, “One Way.”
Another interesting feature of this block is that few of the adults work at legitimate jobs, even though the people who live here are quite poor. The few block residents who work at solid ‐ citizen ‐ type jobs are virtually all 40 or older, and one suspects that with them going to work is a habit. On the other hand, the younger members of this subcommunity appear to be perfectly safe from ever becoming afflicted by this work habit or by the burden of a job. (Practically every male inhabitant of this block who has attained the age of 21 has been in jail for a felony at least once or is there now.) The vast majority under 40 go to bed early in the morning, get up in the afternoon, come out into the street, take numbers, deal some kind of drugs, sell hot goods, pimp, sell their bodies or gamble. There is a store‐front so popular as a gambling spot that it is referred to as Little Vegas. Children know how to shoot crap by the age of 7; and this does not mean merely knowing how to roll the dice but also how to distinguish between making a point and crapping out. Yes, these kids know how to bet. They play for nickels and dimes and seldom win more than 50 cents, but they don't need Cadillacs just yet and 50 cents buys a lot of candy.
Inhabiting this block is an overabundance of rare characters. Without a doubt, one of the most unusual is a 25‐year friend of mine, whom for the sake of anonymity I shall call Dubird. I suppose everybody knows someone like Dubird, but there is no one exactly like him. Dubird is almost a native son of Harlem. He has lived in Harlem for 37 of his 38 years. He knows the community inside out and upside down. Dubird has served time in practically every prison in New York State; he is an incorrigible kibitzer; he's a very volatile personality who thrives on trouble, of which he has had a considerable amount. He is also a hyperactive personality who insists on being involved in everything around him. He is a very dramatic person with an extremely effective gift of gab that of ten falls victim to his inability to restrain his zeal once he has achieved one of his goals. Dubird is a self‐appointed, one ‐ man, grievance‐and‐supervisory committee for the block. He is also a junkie. He has been using heroin off and on for about 17 years. Dubird is a very respected and respectable junkie; people in the block look up to him. He can be counted on to take a stand in a time of trouble, to assume a Sound position in any dispute — without being asked. He can be counted on to fight City Hall and sometimes win. He has ample intelligence and a potent imagination. He reminds me of a village wise man in some African village. People in the block bring their problems to him and are constantly seeking his advice on everything from pigeon food to politics, but he seldom waits for the people to come to him; he prefers to go and find the problems. Like the time he went to the city to request that it take an interest in the block's housing problem.
Under the New York City Real Estate Law, the city has assumed ownership of approximately 14 tenement buildings on this block. If taxes on a certain piece of real estate .are in arrears for three years or more, the city's Department of Real Estate has the right to step in and seize the property; this is usually done. This property is sometimes sold for the taxes and often it is rented or leased and usually the new proprietor is more of a problem than the old. Private slumlords will often discontinue the payment of taxes on a tenement building once they have decided to make no more investments in the property. This means that an already critically deteriorated building can, in fact, be abandoned by the landlord though he continues to collect the complaints about urgently needed repairs and services. Consequently, by the time the city takes possession of the building, it is in such a state of dilapidation that it is frequently unsalvageable. A new law was passed recently which will make it easier, once the law takes effect, for the city to take over property after it has been legally abandoned. But if the past is any indication, what will happen if the city acts at this stage is that the private landlord who has long provided no services or maintenance will be replaced by a municipal landlord who in all but the most conspicuous cases will continue to provide no service or maintenance. A good case in point is what hapMr. Dubird.
About two and a half years ago; the tenement building in which Dubird rents an apartment became the property of New York City, as a result of three years of unpaid taxes. The tenants, who had been complaining to no avail for at least a year about the more than 60 building violations, were notified via the United States mails that “the rent,” as of a certain date, should be paid to the New York City Department of Real Estate. The vast majority of the tenants did not hesitate to comply with this official decree. Dubird, being a bird of a different feather, who had become accustomed to not paying rent for his extremely “humble castle,” certainly was not about to start shelling out unnecessary and undeserved money now just because some white guy downtown, who didn't even know his way to Harlem, had demanded it. Dubird attempted to organize the tenants in a rent strike. The neighbors were afraid and warned him that he might get into trouble. Very few people thought it would be a good idea to have official attention focused on the block—it was “hot” enough already. Accustomed to playing the maverick, Dubird resolved not to pay, and for 14 months did just that. After 13 months, the city began to send “hostile” and threatening letters to Mr. Dubird. As should be expected, he responded in kind. Sometime during the 14th month, the city made the serious mistake of sending Dubird a dispossession notice. Bureaucrats never know when to leave well‐enough alone. Dubird decided that the hour of confrontation had arrived. He would go to see these “marionettes who hide be hind official letterheads and make absurd demands on real people.”
When he arrived at the New York City Department of Real Estate offices, he was given the runaround—as he had expected—for nearly an hour. Eventually, he was directed to a Mr. Zalter, who tried diligently, but unsuccessfully, to give the impression that he was a knowledgeable person of considerable authority. When Dubird presented Mr. Zalter with the notice of dispossession along with a list of nearly 100 building violations that the city had been ignoring for 15 months, while never ceasing to demand rent from the tenants, Mr. Zalter began to explain to Mr. Dubird that the city had not officially assumed ownership of the building, and, therefore, could not make any repairs. This explanation served only to further confuse Mr. Dubird. How could the city legally collect rent and not possess the authority to provide the most basic services? This, Mr. Dubird explained to Mr. Zalter, was a “blatant shakedown.” He also informed Mr. Zalter that for the past 18 months there had been no hot water in his building and that for the past two months there had been no water at all, and no lights in the hallway. The tenants had been lugging water up to their apartments from an open fire hydrant. Dubird suggested that Zalter come up to Harlem and see the remnants of an apartment building that New York City had the unmitigated gall to demand that people pay for the humiliation of sharing with rats and roaches. Of course, Zalter did not feel that such drastic action as a trip to Harlem was necessary to resolve this “misunderstanding.” He suggested that Dubird pay only the marshal's fee and forget about the dispossession notice. Dubird was not amenable to this idea. He had not asked marshals for their services, so why should he have to pay them anything and besides, he felt that New York City should be sued for the return of all the rent that it had illegally collected from tenants while not “officially” owning the building. The New York City Department of Real Estate decided not to pursue the matter any further. A couple of months later, repairs were made in Dubird's building, the water was turned on and Dubird resumed paying his rent.",1973-12-16 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,mumps
39,AstraZeneca Vaccine and Blood Clots: What Is Known So Far,"The AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine has been deployed against Covid-19 in at least 115 countries, some of them for several months now. But it wasn’t until a few cases of a rare blood-clotting disorder — some fatal — emerged within the past month or so that many European nations began to rethink its use across all age groups.
Several of those countries, well stocked with alternate vaccines, have now limited use of the AstraZeneca-Oxford shot to older people, and a few have stopped using it altogether. While the incidence of these clotting disorders is extremely low, regulators and researchers are trying to raise public awareness of certain symptoms — including headaches, leg swelling and abdominal pain — especially in younger people who have been vaccinated.
Public health experts, however, have expressed concern that publicity surrounding the rare vaccine-related reactions will fuel hesitancy, a particular problem in Europe. They continue to emphasize that the AstraZeneca-Oxford vaccine’s benefits far outweigh the risks. In many nations, it is the only vaccine available.
Below are some frequently asked questions.
What is a blood clot and what causes them generally?
A blood clot is a thickened, gelatinous blob of blood that can block circulation. Clots form in response to injuries and can also be caused by many illnesses, including cancer and genetic disorders, certain drugs and prolonged sitting or bed rest. Covid itself can trigger serious clotting problems. Clots that form in the legs sometimes break off and travel to the lungs or, rarely, to the brain, where they can be deadly.",2021-04-10 15:01:20,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,mumps

41,"Barr Testimony: Highlights of Combative Hearing on Protests, Stone Case and More","He also warned that “violent rioters and anarchists have hijacked legitimate protests to wreak senseless havoc and destruction” in places like Portland, Ore.
In his prepared statement, which he did not fully read aloud, Mr. Barr said, “We should all be able to agree that there is no place in this country for armed mobs that seek to establish autonomous zones beyond government control, or tear down statues and monuments that law-abiding communities chose to erect, or to destroy the property and livelihoods of innocent business owners.”
His comments were the latest attempt by federal officials to draw more attention to vandals’ nightly bids to damage federal buildings in Portland, accusing the local police of doing little to stop them. City officials have accused federal agents of being heavy-handed and said their presence reinvigorated tensions that had been subsiding.
The attorney general appears to have played a primary role in using federal agents last month to violently clear protesters from Lafayette Square near the White House before a photo opportunity for Mr. Trump in front of a church. Though the White House initially said Mr. Barr had ordered the clearance, he later said he had not given a “tactical” order. Either way, Democrats were livid over his presence and have come to see Mr. Barr as a key impediment to overhauls of policing that enjoy broad public support.
More recently, he has become a face of the Trump administration’s pledge to surge federal agents into Democratic-led cities like Portland, Ore., Chicago, and Kansas City, Mo. where, the White House says, violence has increased, both during protests and elsewhere. The federal intervention — the details of which remain hazy — is quickly becoming another flash point in the monthslong cultural upheaval over systemic racism, and it appears to be a critical campaign strategy by Mr. Trump who is trying to stoke a sense that Democrats are leading the country into chaos.",2020-07-28 09:00:15,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,tracheoesophageal fistula
42,A ‘Game Changer’ for Patients With Esophageal Cancer,"The patients had all had chemotherapy and radiation followed by surgery to remove their cancers. As usually happens, pathology reports showed that the surgery did not remove all of the cancer cells, which still lurked in lymph nodes and elsewhere, setting the stage in these patients for their cancers to return as incurable metastases.
Nivolumab is approved for some patients with other cancers, like Hodgkin’s lymphoma, melanoma and colorectal cancer. With the new study, experts expect the drug will readily win approval for treatment of early-stage esophageal cancer.
Dr. Ronan Kelly, director of the Charles A. Sammons Cancer Center at Baylor University Medical Center and lead author of the new study, said he and the other researchers urgently wanted to help the 75 percent of patients who go through extraordinarily difficult sequences of radiation, chemotherapy and surgery that disfigures the digestive system, only to learn that cancer is still present or has a high likelihood of recurring.
Without some other form of treatment, “we knew many would recur quickly,” Dr. Kelly said. Additional chemotherapy not only was difficult for patients to tolerate, but it also did not seem to help. Nivolumab has few side effects and seemed worth a try.
Esophageal cancer is rare in the United States, accounting for 1 percent of all cancers; about 15,000 patients die each year.

43,"Finding, and Treating, Esophageal Cancer","Half a century ago, my grandmother died of esophageal cancer. For decades preceding her death, a bottle of milk of magnesia was her steady companion because she suffered daily from heartburn, now known as gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD. But many years passed before a link was clearly established between chronic irritation of the esophagus by stomach acid and this usually fatal cancer.
Now that the role of acid reflux is well known in cancer risk and unpleasant conditions like chronic cough and hoarseness, drug companies market several products, prescription and over the counter, that are far better able to control the backup of stomach acid than milk of magnesia. And gastroenterologists now know to be on the alert for early signs of trouble among patients who suffer from GERD.
The cancer that results from chronic reflux is preceded by a benign condition called Barrett’s esophagus, a cellular abnormality of the esophageal lining that can become precancerous. If untreated, about 10 percent of patients with Barrett’s esophagus eventually develop esophageal cancer, the nation’s fastest-growing cancer. In the last four decades, the annual number of new cases has risen 300 to 500 percent.
The American Cancer Society estimates that 16,470 new cases of esophageal cancer will be diagnosed in this country this year and that more than 14,000 people will die from it.",2008-12-01 21:59:32,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,esophageal
44,Wine may help reduce one form of esophageal cancer,"While millions of Americans suffer from heartburn and gastric reflux disease, only a small number develop more severe ailments that can lead to esophageal cancer. Scientists who have been trying to understand what may protect against these conditions have identified an unlikely agent: wine.
Two studies published this month in the journal Gastroenterology suggest that people who drink wine in moderation are less likely to develop conditions that may lead to esophageal adenocarcinoma, an uncommon cancer that has increased significantly in the United States over the past 30 years.
The reports are surprising because alcohol intake is a well-established risk factor for the other main form of esophageal cancer, squamous cell carcinoma. Researchers therefore warned that the findings were preliminary and must be confirmed by more intensive research.
In one new study, researchers at Kaiser Permanente found that drinking one glass of wine a day was associated with a more than 50 percent reduction in the risk of developing Barrett's esophagus, though there was no reduction in risk for that disorder among those who drank either liquor or beer.",2009-03-04 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,esophageal

46,PERSONAL HEALTH; When Swallowing Food Becomes a Problem,"Chronic disorders like scleroderma (a thickening and hardening of lining tissue) and Sjogren's syndrome (an autoimmune attack on lubricating glands) can also cause the problem, as can weakening of esophageal muscles with age, disruption of coordinated muscular movements in the esophagus, the inability of the lower sphincter to relax (a problem called achalasia), benign or malignant tumors and a pouch in the lining of the throat or esophagus.
Medications taken for long periods can also sometimes disrupt swallowing. They include corticosteroids, anti-inflammatories (both over-the-counter drugs like ibuprofen and prescription drugs like Vioxx ), potassium chloride and quinidine tablets, the antibiotics tetracycline and doxycycline, the bone-building drug alendronate (Fosamax) and drugs that interfere with mental processes. Even iron pills and vitamins can injure the esophagus if taken with too little water and too close to bedtime.
One of the most common but often unrecognized causes of dysphagia is chronic heartburn, also known as gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD. Untreated or ineffectively treated, it can cause chronic inflammation and narrowing of the lower esophagus and may result in esophageal cancer, which is often incurable.
Sometimes infections of the esophagus are the problem, particularly among those with weakened immune systems, like patients who have H.I.V. or who are taking drugs that suppress the immune system.
Occasionally, children are born with birth defects like cleft palate that disrupt swallowing. Even when the defect cannot be corrected, however, children can often be taught to swallow solid food without choking or inhaling it.
Diagnosis and Treatment
In addition to restricting one's social life and enjoyment of food, failure to diagnose and treat swallowing problems can have serious health consequences. People may be unable to consume enough nutritious food to maintain normal weight and health, and they risk developing aspiration pneumonia if food enters the windpipe instead of the esophagus.
Diagnosing and treating dysphagia is often a team effort involving gastroenterologists, otolaryngologists, radiologists, neurologists, and speech and language pathologists who specialize in dysphagia.",2004-07-20 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,esophageal
47,"The Damage of Reflux (Bile, Not Acid)","No one with bile reflux needs to just wait for worse to come, although the remedies are not as simple and well known as they are for acid reflux. The condition usually can be managed with medications, but severe cases may require surgery.
Image
Symptoms and Causes
Both acid reflux and bile reflux may afflict the same person, which can make diagnosis a challenge. But the stomach inflammation that results from bile reflux often causes a burning or gnawing pain in the upper abdomen that is not felt with acid reflux, according to experts at the Mayo Clinic. Other symptoms of bile reflux may include frequent heartburn (the main symptom of acid reflux), nausea, vomiting bile, sometimes a cough or hoarseness and unintended weight loss.
A brief anatomy lesson makes the problem easier to understand. The main organs of the digestive tract are separated by valvelike tissues that, when functioning properly, allow food and digestive fluids to pass in only one direction: down. Thus, as food and liquids pass through the digestive process, they normally travel from the mouth to the throat, then down the esophagus into the stomach, and finally into the small intestine. The opening between the esophagus and stomach, a muscular ring called the lower esophageal sphincter, is meant to keep stomach acid from backing up. When it malfunctions, acid reflux  chronic heartburn  is the usual result.
Likewise, the pyloric valve, the muscular ring between the stomach and small intestine, is supposed to open just enough to permit a fraction of an ounce of liquefied food to pass into the small intestine, but not enough to allow bile to back up into the stomach. When this valve fails to close properly, refluxed bile can cause gastritis, an irritation and inflammation of the stomach lining. Untreated, that can result in a bleeding ulcer or even stomach cancer.
If the esophageal sphincter malfunctions at the same time, or there is a build-up of pressure in the stomach, bile and acid can reach the lower portion of the esophagus, inflaming the delicate lining of this organ. If the problem persists, it can cause scarring that narrows the esophagus, which may result in choking, or the cellular abnormality called Barrett’s esophagus, which can become precancerous and eventually develop into cancer that is nearly always fatal.
Gastroenterologists have recently demonstrated that Barrett’s esophagus can often be effectively treated with radiofrequency therapy, which might help patients like Mrs. Kozma.
Bile reflux can occur as a complication of certain surgeries, like the gallbladder surgery Mrs. Kozma underwent. More often, though, damage to the pyloric valve results from gastric surgery  total removal of the stomach or the gastric bypass operation used to treat morbid obesity.",2009-06-29 20:53:36,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,esophageal
48,Does Lying on the Left Side Ease Heartburn?  Really?,"THE FACTS For people with chronic heartburn, restful sleep is no easy feat. Fall asleep in the wrong position, and acid slips into the esophagus, a recipe for agita and insomnia.
Doctors recommend sleeping on an incline, which allows gravity to keep the stomach’s contents where they belong. But sleeping on your side can also make a difference  so long as you choose the correct side. Several studies have found that sleeping on the right side aggravates heartburn; sleeping on the left tends to calm it.
The reason is not entirely clear. One hypothesis holds that right-side sleeping relaxes the lower esophageal sphincter, between the stomach and the esophagus. Another holds that left-side sleeping keeps the junction between stomach and esophagus above the level of gastric acid.

In a study in The Journal of Clinical Gastroenterology, scientists recruited a group of healthy subjects and fed them high-fat meals on different days to induce heartburn. Immediately after the meals, the subjects spent four hours lying on one side or the other as devices measured their esophageal acidity. Ultimately, the researchers found that “the total amount of reflux time was significantly greater” when the subjects lay on their right side.",2010-10-25 16:37:01,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,esophageal
49,Pop a Pill for Heartburn? Try Diet and Exercise Instead,"One characteristic often associated with acid reflux — being overweight, especially with abdominal obesity — largely explains why the condition has become so common in Western countries. Someone with a body mass index in the overweight range is almost twice as likely to have GERD as a person of normal weight. Losing weight is one of the best ways to find relief without having to rely on medication.
Quitting smoking, limiting alcohol and avoiding carbonated drinks are also important protective measures. Smoking and alcohol can loosen tension of the upper esophageal sphincter and cause symptoms of reflux like hoarseness, postnasal drip and shortness of breath by irritating the mouth, larynx and trachea, Dr. Aviv reports.
Eating big meals, lying down before a meal is digested, and exercising too soon after eating can also trigger symptoms. Reflux sufferers are often advised to eat five or six small meals a day rather than one or two big ones, and to avoid eating within three hours of bedtime. For further protection, the head of the bed can be raised by six inches or more.
But while certain common foods — like raw onions, garlic, citrus juices, coffee and chocolate — are likely to cause reflux in most people with the condition, Dr. Aviv and other experts emphasize that everyone is different, and trial and error is the most effective way to determine an individual’s trigger foods and drinks. Specialists suggest keeping a food and drink diary for a week or two, recording everything consumed and the timing of symptoms to help identify a person’s trigger foods.
A food does not have to be obviously acidic to be troublesome. High-fat foods are problematic for many people because they take a long time to digest. Dr. Aviv points out that many commercially produced foods and drinks are treated with acid-containing substances to enhance flavor and shelf life. Accordingly, the 28-day “healing” diet he suggests consists almost entirely of natural, unprocessed foods, especially lean protein foods like light-meat poultry, fish, egg whites and low-fat dairy, beans (combined with whole grains), and nonacidic vegetables and fruits.
High-fiber foods are very helpful, “second only to eliminating acidic foods,” Dr. Aviv said. Fiber enhances digestion, reducing pressure on the lower esophageal sphincter, and can aid in weight loss and maintenance, among other benefits like reducing inflammation. Try to eat a pound of vegetables each day, half of which are cooked and the other half eaten raw, as well as half a pound of raw fruit. Good sources include broccoli, carrots, beets, green leafy vegetables, apples, berries, bananas, avocados and pears. Other helpful fiber-rich foods include almonds, walnuts, lentils, chickpeas and lima beans.
If adopting the above measures fails to fully control acid reflux, taking a proton pump inhibitor may also be needed. But a P.P.I. should be used in the lowest effective dose at the correct time and for the shortest possible period, experts say. “Studies have revealed that 80 percent of Americans may be taking these powerful meds incorrectly,” Dr. Aviv wrote. He said they should be taken 30 to 60 minutes before eating breakfast or dinner (or both), but not used as an “antidote” to consuming acidic foods.",2017-03-20 10:00:04,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,esophageal

52,Hyperemesis Gravidarum: When Morning Sickness Is So Extreme You Can’t Function,"Find an experienced doctor.
If your doctor or midwife isn’t concerned about your symptoms or is resistant to giving you medication, find a doctor who is experienced in high-risk pregnancies and hyperemesis. Many ob-gyns see only a handful of hyperemesis patients each year and may not understand the seriousness of the condition. You can find a list of HG-experienced doctors on the HER Foundation website.
Doctors can prescribe several drugs to reduce nausea and vomiting that are safe to take during pregnancy, including certain antacids, antihistamines and anti-emetics. Vitamin B6 alone, or combined with the antihistamine doxylamine in a drug called Diclegis, is a common first-line approach. Zofran (ondansetron), which targets the nausea center in the brain, is another frequently prescribed drug, and can be swallowed or injected. Most drugs are not specifically approved for hyperemesis, so pregnant women must take these drugs off-label, but MacGibbon noted that studies find no major problems in the children of women who receive these medications.
A warning about marijuana.
With marijuana becoming legal in some states, more pregnant women are trying cannabis products thinking they’re a natural way to treat nausea. Dr. Deirdre Lyell, M.D., a professor of maternal-fetal medicine at Stanford University, cautioned that while marijuana does not appear to cause major physical birth defects, existing research suggests that it can affect brain development of the fetus, though it’s not known by how much. “I don’t think that there’s enough data about its use,” Dr. Lyell said. “There are a lot of other good alternatives to marijuana.”
Seek support.
Even with medication, some women suffering from hyperemesis have a hard time even getting out of bed and may need to take a leave of absence from work and offload chores and childcare duties onto friends or family members. Dr. Lyell especially recommended that women stay out of the kitchen, as cooking smells are common nausea triggers.
Dr. Marlena Fejzo, Ph.D., a geneticist who researches hyperemesis at the University of California, Los Angeles and University of Southern California, and who has suffered from the condition herself, recommended that women recruit a spouse or friend to be their advocate during doctor visits. “When you get so weak and you’re so nauseous, a lot of times you can’t really advocate for yourself,” Dr. Fejzo said.
Because staying home sick can be incredibly isolating, all of the experts I talked to recommend finding online support groups. “I usually don’t advise my patients to go to Google to compare their treatments,” said Dr. Irina Burd, M.D., Ph.D., director of the Integrated Research Center for Fetal Medicine at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, “but I do advise them to join a group of folks. I think the support is what’s most important.”
Understand that there’s a lot we don’t know about hyperemesis.
Considering that hyperemesis affects an estimated 0.3 to 3 percent of pregnancies and is the most common reason for hospitalization in the first part of pregnancy, it may be surprising how little we know about it. Up until the 1960s, medical schools taught that hyperemesis was a psychological condition and that unhappy women were vomiting to get attention. Even now, many people think of pregnancy nausea as a condition that lasts only three months and then disappears on its own. Therapies for hyperemesis certainly have room for improvement, but Dr. Fejzo blames thalidomide, a drug marketed in the 1950s to treat morning sickness that caused serious birth defects, for scaring drug companies from creating new remedies. When existing medications are ineffective, some women find hyperemesis to be so unbearable that they undergo a therapeutic termination.",2020-04-17 22:19:58,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,mallory-weiss syndrome

There he studied English and philosophy, married and separated, edited the student literary magazine (and was relieved of his duties after emblazoning the cover of one issue with the slogan ''Man will never be free until the last king is strangled with the entrails of the last priest'' while the university was host to a religious conference), worked on the rough draft of his first novel, ''Jonathan Troy,'' did an 80-page treatise on anarchism as his master's thesis and won a Fulbright scholarship for postgraduate work at the University of Edinburgh.
From there, the story becomes more familiar: the years of working for the Forest Service as fire lookout and ranger, the slow accretion of success as a writer of meticulously observed essays focused on the West, his emergence as the spiritual father of the radical environment movement after the publication of his two seminal books, ''Desert Solitaire'' (1968) and ''The Monkey Wrench Gang'' (1975). What was most remarkable about Abbey, however, was the cult that grew up around him. Here was a man who took on the aura of the redeemer, replete with his nonconformist preachings, his sojourn in the desert and his furtive burial by a band of disciples in the arid hills he apotheosized, a man whose work inspired the eco-sabotage of Earth First and other direct-action groups. This was a life. A life of excitement, scandal, provocation, sex, alcohol (Abbey died, at 62, of esophageal varices, a malady associated with alcoholism) and the inherent mysticism of the deepest dwelling in nature. If ever there was a subject fit for a thumping, exhilarating, wild ride of a biography, Abbey was it.
Unfortunately, two new books fall somewhat short of the mark, though taken together, they present a detailed account of Abbey's life and will certainly provide the building blocks for a definitive biography. James M. Cahalan's ''Edward Abbey: A Life'' is thoroughly researched and impeccable in its recitation of the facts, but it is a he-went-where-when account that leaves its subject curiously lifeless on the page. It is at its best when quoting from Abbey's books, letters and journals, and Cahalan has unearthed some of Abbey's finest bons mots along the way. He is reticent, however, on the subject of Abbey's marriages and endless sexual dalliances, he offers no literary analysis and little insight into Abbey's mind. His stated purpose is to demythologize Abbey, ''to separate fact from fiction and reality from myth,'' and he does an admirable job of correcting many of the misapprehensions surrounding Abbey's life, not the least of which were fostered by Abbey himself in the service of refining his own image. And to be fair to Cahalan, who is a professor of English at Indiana University of Pennsylvania, he was apparently operating under strict limits imposed by his publisher. He defends his method by stating that ''Abbey's life needs no embellishment. The simple facts alone are more than lively enough by themselves.'' In this case, they are not. In fact, the portrait of Abbey on the front cover -- the dirt-rimmed hat, the graying beard, the raptor's beak and cranky, mad, Trickster's eyes -- is in many ways more revealing than all of Cahalan's marshaled facts.
Jack Loeffler's account, ''Adventures With Ed: A Portrait of Abbey,'' isn't nearly so ambitious -- it is a memoir -- but it presents the central outline of Abbey's life and provides original material about his youth gleaned from interviews with his father, sister and brother. More important, it tells stories. Loeffler, an ethno-musicologist and radio producer in Santa Fe, was one of Abbey's closest associates, one of his compañeros, the buddies with whom he would drink, camp, philosophize, cruise the deserts and hike the canyons of the sun-blasted Southwest. Loeffler is given to pronouncements (''It was inspiring to see this man, now approaching 60, still caught in the sway of his ideals, still consumed by fires kindled in his own childhood that ever burned on behalf of justice and freedom''), and his detailed reconstruction of campfire disquisitions with Abbey seem to take a great deal of license. Did he have a tape recorder? The auditory equivalent of a photographic memory? That said, Loeffler's portrait brings Abbey to life in the way that Cahalan's biography does not, and his account of Abbey's death and illegal burial at a secret location in the hills is all the better for it. Loeffler was present. He helped dig the grave. He mourned. And these passages are more than informative, more than instructive -- they are elegiac and heartbreaking.
Finally, if I could step out from under the shade of the reviewer's umbrella for a moment, I'd like to say that I admired Abbey's work -- particularly his nonfiction -- before I picked up these two books, and that now I've come to feel his influence ever more deeply. His ideas that once seemed so radical -- excluding cars from national parks, preserving wild places intact, reintroducing predators to our depleted ecosystems, taking down the dams that have killed off our rivers -- now seem prophetic. Edward Abbey was an atavism -- the pioneer heading down the river on a raft, a smile on his face and a satiric twinkle in his eye, bowing to no one and gleefully goading everyone he met, especially those who held any sort of office or power. He put it this way: ''I write to entertain my friends and to exasperate our enemies.'' What better credo?",2002-02-10 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,esophageal varices
54,New Drug for Bleeding Is Given Mixed Reports,"Doctors have expressed disappointment that a new drug thought to be effective against excessive bleeding caused by liver disease has fallen short of expectations, according to a report published in The New England Journal of Medicine.
The researchers studied the effect of the drug propranolol on esophageal varices, which are enlarged veins in the throat that can burst, causing the victim to bleed to death.
Esophageal varices are caused by liver disease.
A report in 1981 found propranolol to be very effective against esophageal varices. But the new report from the Royal Free Hospital School of Medicine in Hamstead, England, said the drug had little effect.
''These results are very disappointing, to say the least,'' Dr. Telfer B. Reynolds, of the University of Southern California School of Medicine in Los Angeles, said Wednesday in an accompanying editorial.",1983-12-25 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,esophageal varices
55,More Americans Are Dying of Cirrhosis and Liver Cancer,"Deaths from cirrhosis and liver cancer are rising dramatically in the United States.
From 1999 to 2016, annual cirrhosis deaths increased by 65 percent, to 34,174, according to a study published in the journal BMJ. The largest increases were related to alcoholic cirrhosis among people ages 25 to 34 years old.
From 2009 to 2016 there was a 10.5 percent annual increase on average in cirrhosis-related mortality among people ages 25 to 34.
Cirrhosis, irreversible scarring of the liver, has many causes, including alcohol consumption, obesity, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease and hepatitis.

56,THE MAKING OF A DOCTOR,"But once they complete their training, doctors catch up soon enough. According to the most recent figures available, the average doctor earns $79,700 per year, which varies from specialty to specialty and age group to age group. The average 35-year-old internist in 1979, for example, was earning $60,100; those between 36 and 40 were earining $86,300, and internists between 41 and 50 earned $84,000. These figures are somewhat anomalous; the internist's income usually peaks closer to the national average, between 41 and 45. The average surgeon earns a little more: At 35 he or she earned $77,800; between 36 and 40, $99,700; between 41 and 45, $112,400; a little over $100,000 between 46 and 60. Anesthesiologists tend to earn more than surgeons; psychiatrists and pediatricians tend to earn less than physicians in other fields. In New York, all of these figures are a bit higher.
The reasons that doctors' incomes peak comparatively early is that they have been in debt for so long and have started earning competitively so late that they feel pressured to catch up and are more aggressive in seeking patients. Their income may decrease after 45, because then they are more likely to respond to demands from their families to spend more time at home.
General medical costs have increased even faster than doctors' incomes. When Dr. Kenigsberg was in medical school in 1940, the aggregate national health-care expenditure -everything from office visits to building medical schools - was $4 billion. Twenty years later, it was $26.9 billion, and, in 1980, it had jumped to $247.2 billion. Personal health care increased as dramatically: from $10.9 billion in 1950 (1940 figures are unavailable) to $23.7 billion in 1960, and $217.9 billion in 1980. To give a sense of what it means to an individual, in the last 10 years alone, an office visit to a general practitioner has increased from $8.46 to $18.21, and fees in New York are much higher.
If the professional rewards are more gratifying and the financial rewards greater than in the past, the rites of passage are more intimidating than ever as is illustrated by the odyssey of Aaron Kenigsberg. I. Into the Real World During his junior year at Stanford University in Palo Alto, Calif., Aaron worked at the student health center as a ward assistant; the following summer, he was a research assistant to Dr. Craig Heller, an associate professor in Stanford's department of biological sciences. He graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree in biology in January 1979, and, after half a year spent traveling through Europe, taking photographs - a common hobby for doctors - Aaron entered the New York University School of Medicine.
Aaron looks younger than his age, which was 23 when he started his third year last fall, and he is sensitive about what he once referred to as his ''baby face.'' He is very proud of his three older siblings: his sister, Ruth, 27, who was expected to graduate from law school last week; his oldest brother, Martin, a 30-year-old clinical psychologist, and, especially, his other brother, David, a 29-yearold doctor who went to the University of California (San Francisco) Medical School and is now doing a residency in family practice in the Amish country of Pennsylvania. The tug of David's idealism is powerful, and the idea of family practice -with its emphasis on preventive medicine - appeals to Aaron.
But specialization - knowing a field in depth - is also tempting to Aaron, and in this he is encouraged by his father, who is an internist and the physician in charge of the health center of the Union Family Medical Fund of the Hotel Industry of New York City. Aaron, of all the children, is considered by the family to be most like his father. And, if Aaron went to undergraduate school in California because of his brother David, he went to N.Y.U. because of his father.
Aaron was entering his third year with more experience than some of his classmates. In addition to his college jobs, he had spent a year at the Veterans Administration Hospital as a laboratory technician running blood tests, and, last summer, he had done his obstetrics-gynecology clerkship. Still, he approached the year a little nervously.",1982-05-23 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,esophageal varices
57,The 2015 Sidney Awards,"It is time once again for the Sidney Awards, when I pick out some of the best long-form essays that you might download for your holiday reading pleasure. This year there were so many fine pieces it’s impossible to read them all without totally ignoring your family.
The first two winners are just great narratives. In “The Man Who Tried to Redeem the World With Logic” in Nautilus, Amanda Gefter described the partnership between Walter Pitts and Warren McCulloch. These two geniuses fit together perfectly. They performed amazing intellectual feats, the first of which was coming up with a working model for how the brain works and laying the groundwork for artificial intelligence.
They also developed an amazing friendship. At one point when they were apart, Pitts wrote McCulloch, “About once a week now I become violently homesick to talk all evening and all night to you.”
Only one person was unhappy with this arrangement: the wife of a third colleague who was jealous of her husband’s academic relationships. She told her husband, falsely, that their daughter had been seduced by his colleagues. That ruptured the whole network of ties.",2015-12-18 08:20:03,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,esophageal varices
58,Wrong Image Of Layne,"To the Sports Editor:
Dave Anderson's misty-eyed and romanticized picture of Bobby Layne (''Ol' Bobby's Time Ran Out,'' The New York Times, Dec. 4) does a disservice to a premier athlete who, because of his drinking, never achieved his full potential and has died prematurely. It is also a disservice to all of the starry-eyed teen-agers looking for a role model to paint a compassionate picture of the swaggering athlete hero who was a hard ''drinker, not a drunk.''
Regardless of how you slice it, drinking impaired his life. The cute stories of how he ran into a ''parked swerving streetcar'' or how he drove down a one-way street in the wrong direction not only give the readers a laugh, but they imply acceptance of such behavior, if not condoning it. This one article undoes an enormous amount of hard work by many important groups, like Mothers Against Drunk Driving. It's not sexy to say ''don't drink and drive,'' but it sure comes across clearly when Dave Anderson quotes a sign in the Lions' locker room saying ''Ah ain't drunk. Ah'm from Texas.'' Think of how much better he could have been, on and off the field, without the alcohol.
Lastly, it was more than ol' Bobby's time that ran out, it was his liver, apparently damaged by alcohol over the years, and, presumably complicated by the myriad organ damage seen in the chronic alcoholic (e.g. alcohol cardiomyopathy, perhaps bleeding from esophageal varices, possibly liver failure) that ''done ol' Bobby in.'' And the shame of it is that it didn't have to be. It was, apparently, self-induced.
To hold up a charming picture of the rough-and-tumble drug-abusing athlete (for alcohol is a drug and that's what the alcoholic does) as a super hero for the current generation is dishonest. He is an example, but a tragically bad example. Picking up a ''party tab for . . . all the other rookies'' is the wrong macho image to send.",1986-12-21 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,esophageal varices

61,America’s Public Restrooms Are Kind of Great Now,"Over the last two decades, though I’ve undergone dozens of invasive procedures and tests, taken a panoply of pills and had various parts of my digestive system removed or surgically rebuilt, my symptoms have only gotten more intense and more — how to put this delicately? — expansive. Swallowing food is now an arduous enough task that I have to get much of my nutrition through liquid: As Kanye once rapped, “I drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessert.” But it’s no longer just eating that’s a pain; it’s what happens after, too. From the nave to the chops, my swallowing problem has spawned a gross-out comedy’s worth of G.I. complications.
The ugly upshot is this: At least once every day and sometimes many times, I have to run to the restroom on a moment’s notice, and what happens to me there is best experienced alone, in blissful, unembarrassed solitude.
I tell you all this, in order to establish my bona fides: I know public bathrooms. In my travels, over the years, I have assembled in my head a veritable Michelin Guide of private, peaceful places to go. So trust me when I tell you that in the last few years, better public bathrooms have started to pop up everywhere. Again and again, in big cities and small, in red states and blue, in airports, hotels, shopping malls, theaters, stadiums, offices and a range of other public venues, I’ve been saved by a bounty of better loos.
More restrooms are now explicitly inclusive and accessible, designed for people who are physically disabled; are gender nonconforming; are traveling with children; or are otherwise in need of special accommodation. (For instance, paruresis and parcopresis, phobias that inhibit people from urinating or defecating in public restrooms, are real, debilitating conditions that affect tens of millions of people.)
One innovation that has been of particular use to me is the lockable, single-occupancy, all-gender restroom. A decade ago, in most public places, it was nigh impossible to find a private place to do your business. Today, these one-person stalls are a rising trend across the country, especially at airports and other large public facilities. In some places they’re labeled “all gender” restrooms; in others, they’re called “family” bathrooms; in yet others, signs welcome everyone with broad language, like, “All persons may use this restroom.” Whatever you call them, they’re a haven in a world marked by chaos and disorder. Over the last few years, when nature called suddenly and panic set in, I’ve had the fortune of finding a clean, private place at, among other locations, the Guggenheim in New York; the Getty Center in Los Angeles; the Mall of America; a dozen airports, at least; and so, so many Starbucks.",2019-12-11 21:15:44,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,achalasia
62,PERSONAL HEALTH; When Swallowing Food Becomes a Problem,"Chronic disorders like scleroderma (a thickening and hardening of lining tissue) and Sjogren's syndrome (an autoimmune attack on lubricating glands) can also cause the problem, as can weakening of esophageal muscles with age, disruption of coordinated muscular movements in the esophagus, the inability of the lower sphincter to relax (a problem called achalasia), benign or malignant tumors and a pouch in the lining of the throat or esophagus.
Medications taken for long periods can also sometimes disrupt swallowing. They include corticosteroids, anti-inflammatories (both over-the-counter drugs like ibuprofen and prescription drugs like Vioxx ), potassium chloride and quinidine tablets, the antibiotics tetracycline and doxycycline, the bone-building drug alendronate (Fosamax) and drugs that interfere with mental processes. Even iron pills and vitamins can injure the esophagus if taken with too little water and too close to bedtime.
One of the most common but often unrecognized causes of dysphagia is chronic heartburn, also known as gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD. Untreated or ineffectively treated, it can cause chronic inflammation and narrowing of the lower esophagus and may result in esophageal cancer, which is often incurable.
Sometimes infections of the esophagus are the problem, particularly among those with weakened immune systems, like patients who have H.I.V. or who are taking drugs that suppress the immune system.
Occasionally, children are born with birth defects like cleft palate that disrupt swallowing. Even when the defect cannot be corrected, however, children can often be taught to swallow solid food without choking or inhaling it.
Diagnosis and Treatment
In addition to restricting one's social life and enjoyment of food, failure to diagnose and treat swallowing problems can have serious health consequences. People may be unable to consume enough nutritious food to maintain normal weight and health, and they risk developing aspiration pneumonia if food enters the windpipe instead of the esophagus.
Diagnosing and treating dysphagia is often a team effort involving gastroenterologists, otolaryngologists, radiologists, neurologists, and speech and language pathologists who specialize in dysphagia.",2004-07-20 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,achalasia
63,The Best Heating Pad,"The PureRelief XL King Size Heating Pad was the consensus favorite pad of our testers and offers features found in no other heating pad that’s similarly priced. The smooth and plush sides of its cover were our testers’ overall favorite, and although it does make a bit more crinkling noise when bending than some, it’s reasonably quiet. The PureRelief’s six levels of heating (between 105 and 140 degrees Fahrenheit) fall within the same general range as other pads’ minimum and maximum levels (give or take 5 degrees) but offer the smallest gaps between temperatures. This addresses a common complaint among the heating pad users on our panel who noted “medium is too low, but high is too hot,” and makes this pad easier to adjust to the right temperature than pads with a narrower range of options and larger jumps between settings. The larger version of this heating pad, the XXL Extra Wide, features the same heating levels and is just as plush, but is nearly double the size.
The PureRelief’s controller is simple to use, allowing you to turn the heat up or down, turn the auto-off timer on or off, and turn the pad on or off. Other pads require you to cycle through settings (such as off/low/medium/high), making it more likely that you’ll accidentally leave the pad on, or just force you to click multiple times to simply go down one level. The PureRelief’s LCD screen has big numbers and backlighting, as opposed to the tiny red lights and lettering on most controllers. The PureRelief cord stays firmly plugged into the pad and will not come loose, unlike the cord on some pads we tested. Its cover dried faster than most pads after washing, it comes with the minor convenience of a storage bag, and it is warrantied for five years.

Our testers preferred the feel of the PureRelief’s plush side, as it seemed gentle against the skin but not, like another pad, so dense that it would cause excessive perspiration or feel “like a sweaty pillow,” one said. One tester thought the PureRelief made louder crinkling noises when bent than other pads, but others found it quieter. The cleaning instructions for the PureRelief are admittedly a bit fussier than those for other pads (wash in cold water on a delicate cycle, dry on low heat or on a line), but it dried out more fully on a line than other pads within a couple of hours.
Flaws but not dealbreakers
The PureRelief’s cover requires gentler washing than others we tested: washing on the delicate cycle with cold water and drying on the delicates cycle rather than the medium setting most pads can tolerate. While its plug stays firmly connected to the base of the pad, its locking tabs could be tough to disengage for people with large hands or pain in their fingers.
One of our long-term testers found that the PureRelief can have problems maintaining temperatures for long periods of time. In their experience, after about 30 minutes of use, the PureRelief tends to cool down, requiring them to increase the number in order to start the heat again.
The PureRelief has maintained an overall rating of above four out of five stars after more than 24,000 reviews by verified purchasers since September 2016. After noticing an uptick in negative reviews, specifically citing nonfunctioning units, during early fall 2018, we contacted the company. Terry Cox, speaking for the heating pad’s maker, Pure Enrichment, said negative reviews were increasing because overall sales increased as winter approached, but the percentage of negative reviews remained roughly the same. Cox said Pure Enrichment would provide money-back returns for nonfunctioning or underperforming pads 60 days beyond Amazon’s standard 30-day return period; customers can email help@pureenrichment.com to start the process. This policy is in addition to Pure Enrichment’s five-year warranty, which covers defects including a failure to heat up.",2017-09-21 00:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,achalasia
64,The Infection That’s Silently Killing Coronavirus Patients,"Pneumonia is an infection of the lungs in which the air sacs fill with fluid or pus. Normally, patients develop chest discomfort, pain with breathing and other breathing problems. But when Covid pneumonia first strikes, patients don’t feel short of breath, even as their oxygen levels fall. And by the time they do, they have alarmingly low oxygen levels and moderate-to-severe pneumonia (as seen on chest X-rays). Normal oxygen saturation for most persons at sea level is 94 to 100 percent; Covid pneumonia patients I saw had oxygen saturations as low as 50 percent.
To my amazement, most patients I saw said they had been sick for a week or so with fever, cough, upset stomach and fatigue, but they only became short of breath the day they came to the hospital. Their pneumonia had clearly been going on for days, but by the time they felt they had to go to the hospital, they were often already in critical condition.
In emergency departments we insert breathing tubes in critically ill patients for a variety of reasons. In my 30 years of practice, however, most patients requiring emergency intubation are in shock, have altered mental status or are grunting to breathe. Patients requiring intubation because of acute hypoxia are often unconscious or using every muscle they can to take a breath. They are in extreme duress. Covid pneumonia cases are very different.
A vast majority of Covid pneumonia patients I met had remarkably low oxygen saturations at triage — seemingly incompatible with life — but they were using their cellphones as we put them on monitors. Although breathing fast, they had relatively minimal apparent distress, despite dangerously low oxygen levels and terrible pneumonia on chest X-rays.
We are only just beginning to understand why this is so. The coronavirus attacks lung cells that make surfactant. This substance helps the air sacs in the lungs stay open between breaths and is critical to normal lung function. As the inflammation from Covid pneumonia starts, it causes the air sacs to collapse, and oxygen levels fall. Yet the lungs initially remain “compliant,” not yet stiff or heavy with fluid. This means patients can still expel carbon dioxide — and without a buildup of carbon dioxide, patients do not feel short of breath.
Share Your Stories From the Front Lines We want to hear from doctors, nurses and health care workers around the world.
Patients compensate for the low oxygen in their blood by breathing faster and deeper — and this happens without their realizing it. This silent hypoxia, and the patient’s physiological response to it, causes even more inflammation and more air sacs to collapse, and the pneumonia worsens until oxygen levels plummet. In effect, patients are injuring their own lungs by breathing harder and harder. Twenty percent of Covid pneumonia patients then go on to a second and deadlier phase of lung injury. Fluid builds up and the lungs become stiff, carbon dioxide rises, and patients develop acute respiratory failure.",2020-04-20 19:00:10,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,achalasia

A waiter catered to his and his girlfriend’s every need, recharging Smith for the parade that awaited him when he landed.
He rode in the back of a convertible and waved at the thousands of people cheering along Main Street U.S.A. at Disney World, where he did not even have time to sample a turkey leg. He signed some footballs, spoke to some reporters, went on a ride — only one, and he doesn’t remember which — and gaped at fans wearing his No. 53 Seattle Seahawks jersey.

67,A Rare Genetic Mutation Leads to Cancer. The Fix May Already Be in the Drugstore.,"Pten activity is somewhat impaired in the vast majority of human cancers. A drug that reactivates the gene could help curb cancer growth.
Dr. Mustafa Sahin, an expert on the Pten gene at Boston Children’s Hospital, called the new research a “tour de force study.” The result is “a paradigm shift in the field and very exciting in terms of its therapeutic implications,” Dr. Sahin, who was not involved in the research, wrote in an email.
Dr. Pier Paolo Pandolfi, senior author of the paper and director of the cancer center at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, has spent years trying to find a way to restore Pten activity.
The gene governs production of an enzyme that stops cells from dividing too quickly, reducing the chances that cancers will form. With reduced activity in Pten, cells grow uncontrollably .
Pten mutations do not completely halt the gene’s functions . Instead, the mutations tamp down the gene’s activity, so cells make less of the enzyme needed for orderly growth.
But one of the hardest things for researchers to do is to find a way to increase, rather than turn off, a gene’s activity. Eventually, Dr. Pandolfi and his colleagues learned enough about the Pten system to reason that i3c might do the trick.
“We got lucky, or smart,” he said.
Dr. Pandolfi and his colleagues tested their treatment on human prostate cancer cells and in mice bred to develop prostate cancer. It worked: In the cells and in mice, i3c treatment resulted in fewer cancers, and those that arose were small and less deadly.",2019-05-17 18:42:23,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,achalasia
68,"The Damage of Reflux (Bile, Not Acid)","No one with bile reflux needs to just wait for worse to come, although the remedies are not as simple and well known as they are for acid reflux. The condition usually can be managed with medications, but severe cases may require surgery.
Image
Symptoms and Causes
Both acid reflux and bile reflux may afflict the same person, which can make diagnosis a challenge. But the stomach inflammation that results from bile reflux often causes a burning or gnawing pain in the upper abdomen that is not felt with acid reflux, according to experts at the Mayo Clinic. Other symptoms of bile reflux may include frequent heartburn (the main symptom of acid reflux), nausea, vomiting bile, sometimes a cough or hoarseness and unintended weight loss.
A brief anatomy lesson makes the problem easier to understand. The main organs of the digestive tract are separated by valvelike tissues that, when functioning properly, allow food and digestive fluids to pass in only one direction: down. Thus, as food and liquids pass through the digestive process, they normally travel from the mouth to the throat, then down the esophagus into the stomach, and finally into the small intestine. The opening between the esophagus and stomach, a muscular ring called the lower esophageal sphincter, is meant to keep stomach acid from backing up. When it malfunctions, acid reflux  chronic heartburn  is the usual result.
Likewise, the pyloric valve, the muscular ring between the stomach and small intestine, is supposed to open just enough to permit a fraction of an ounce of liquefied food to pass into the small intestine, but not enough to allow bile to back up into the stomach. When this valve fails to close properly, refluxed bile can cause gastritis, an irritation and inflammation of the stomach lining. Untreated, that can result in a bleeding ulcer or even stomach cancer.
If the esophageal sphincter malfunctions at the same time, or there is a build-up of pressure in the stomach, bile and acid can reach the lower portion of the esophagus, inflaming the delicate lining of this organ. If the problem persists, it can cause scarring that narrows the esophagus, which may result in choking, or the cellular abnormality called Barrett’s esophagus, which can become precancerous and eventually develop into cancer that is nearly always fatal.
Gastroenterologists have recently demonstrated that Barrett’s esophagus can often be effectively treated with radiofrequency therapy, which might help patients like Mrs. Kozma.
Bile reflux can occur as a complication of certain surgeries, like the gallbladder surgery Mrs. Kozma underwent. More often, though, damage to the pyloric valve results from gastric surgery  total removal of the stomach or the gastric bypass operation used to treat morbid obesity.",2009-06-29 20:53:36,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,reflux
69,Love and Reflux,"It was also not a beautiful addition to the bedroom. I pride myself on an inviting bed; I have antique pillowcases and down comforters and fat and malleable pillows that, like a whimsically illustrated children’s book, are meant to excite the imagination: “Hey, baby, why don’t we stack up all those pillows like a throne and I’ll be the evil pharaoh and you can be the sultry-eyed Jewish slave.”
This MedSlant pillow was more like Picasso in his Cubist period, hard and geometric. It also screamed “woman with medical problem,” which, I can tell you from my experiences in online dating, is one thing men never say they want.
The pillow also took up a tremendous amount of space. You might think I could hide the thing under the bed if love struck suddenly, but it was too fat to fit under the bed. It could barely be stuffed into the bedroom closet. I walked around the apartment with it, searching for hiding places that could be used quickly. Behind the desk with a 10-yard pass? It could work if my date were in the kitchen making drinks, but if he came out sooner than expected it would be awkward.
“Was that a reflux pillow I just saw flying through the air?”
“No, no, it was my small white dog, Tubby, who died just a few moments ago of silent canine cardio disease. I didn’t want to ruin the evening, so I tossed him in the corner. Tomorrow I shall take a picture of his stiff little body and tastefully announce his passing on Facebook. Oh, no! You too recently lost your dog to silent canine cardio disease? No, no, I understand. Of course you need to go home and be alone with your grief.”
I put the ugly reflux pillow back on the bed and studied it, wondering how it could be disguised — normal pillows on either side, perhaps.
Then I realized something: If you turned the reflux pillow around so that the steep side was at the bottom you suddenly had a sex pillow. As they say in the home décor business, I had repurposed a medical pillow. The pillow, jutting lasciviously up from under the down comforter, now suggested filthy erotic possibilities; it was an accessory every man looking for love on the Seniors Unable to Commit But Fear Dying Alone dating sites would hope to find in a woman’s boudoir.",2014-11-14 15:12:23,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,reflux

71,"Treating Acid Reflux, With Drugs and Lifestyle Changes","To the Editor:
Re “The Dangers of Eating Late at Night” (Sunday Review, Oct. 26):
Dr. Jamie A. Koufman writes that certain medications intended to treat acid reflux disease called proton pump inhibitors, or P.P.I.’s, were shown in a Danish study to increase the risk for esophageal cancer. In fact, there is a role for medication in the treatment of acid reflux disease, and patients should not stop taking their medications without consulting their physicians.
The Danish study’s authors acknowledged that they were unable to control for risk factors for esophageal cancer like alcohol consumption, which can alter the findings significantly. But numerous other studies suggest that P.P.I.’s may give a protective effect against the precursor to esophageal cancer as well as to esophageal cancer itself.
Most patients prefer not to use medication to treat their acid reflux disease for many reasons, including the well-documented, long-term side effects of these medications: the development of osteoporosis, as well as kidney and heart problems.
That’s a powerful reason to try, whenever possible, to treat acid reflux with a low-acid, high-fiber balanced diet and to keep in mind what we tell our patients: “The kitchen closes at 7:30 p.m.”",2014-11-02 23:50:12,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,reflux

Unfortunately for coffee or wine lovers who already suffer from reflux, the study's lead researcher said the findings did not mean a green light for their consumption.
Coffee and alcohol, with favorites like chocolate and spicy foods, can still bring on symptoms in reflux patients even if they play no role in its development, said the researcher, Dr. Magnus Nilsson of the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm.",2004-11-16 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,reflux

74,Pop a Pill for Heartburn? Try Diet and Exercise Instead,"One characteristic often associated with acid reflux — being overweight, especially with abdominal obesity — largely explains why the condition has become so common in Western countries. Someone with a body mass index in the overweight range is almost twice as likely to have GERD as a person of normal weight. Losing weight is one of the best ways to find relief without having to rely on medication.
Quitting smoking, limiting alcohol and avoiding carbonated drinks are also important protective measures. Smoking and alcohol can loosen tension of the upper esophageal sphincter and cause symptoms of reflux like hoarseness, postnasal drip and shortness of breath by irritating the mouth, larynx and trachea, Dr. Aviv reports.
Eating big meals, lying down before a meal is digested, and exercising too soon after eating can also trigger symptoms. Reflux sufferers are often advised to eat five or six small meals a day rather than one or two big ones, and to avoid eating within three hours of bedtime. For further protection, the head of the bed can be raised by six inches or more.
But while certain common foods — like raw onions, garlic, citrus juices, coffee and chocolate — are likely to cause reflux in most people with the condition, Dr. Aviv and other experts emphasize that everyone is different, and trial and error is the most effective way to determine an individual’s trigger foods and drinks. Specialists suggest keeping a food and drink diary for a week or two, recording everything consumed and the timing of symptoms to help identify a person’s trigger foods.
A food does not have to be obviously acidic to be troublesome. High-fat foods are problematic for many people because they take a long time to digest. Dr. Aviv points out that many commercially produced foods and drinks are treated with acid-containing substances to enhance flavor and shelf life. Accordingly, the 28-day “healing” diet he suggests consists almost entirely of natural, unprocessed foods, especially lean protein foods like light-meat poultry, fish, egg whites and low-fat dairy, beans (combined with whole grains), and nonacidic vegetables and fruits.
High-fiber foods are very helpful, “second only to eliminating acidic foods,” Dr. Aviv said. Fiber enhances digestion, reducing pressure on the lower esophageal sphincter, and can aid in weight loss and maintenance, among other benefits like reducing inflammation. Try to eat a pound of vegetables each day, half of which are cooked and the other half eaten raw, as well as half a pound of raw fruit. Good sources include broccoli, carrots, beets, green leafy vegetables, apples, berries, bananas, avocados and pears. Other helpful fiber-rich foods include almonds, walnuts, lentils, chickpeas and lima beans.
If adopting the above measures fails to fully control acid reflux, taking a proton pump inhibitor may also be needed. But a P.P.I. should be used in the lowest effective dose at the correct time and for the shortest possible period, experts say. “Studies have revealed that 80 percent of Americans may be taking these powerful meds incorrectly,” Dr. Aviv wrote. He said they should be taken 30 to 60 minutes before eating breakfast or dinner (or both), but not used as an “antidote” to consuming acidic foods.",2017-03-20 10:00:04,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,reflux
75,Rise Seen in Disorder That May Hint Cancer,"Thus far, scientists have found no link between the syndrome and either alcohol or cigarettes, known to be risk factors for esophageal cancer. Nor do they believe that improvements in detecting the disorder are enough to explain the apparent increase.
The cancer associated with the syndrome, called adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, remains relatively rare, afflicting only about 2 in 100,000 white men each year. But the incidence has soared among that group by an astounding 100 percent since 1976, and the age of onset seems to be dipping ominously.
""It's a novel pattern,"" said Dr. William J. Blot of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Md. ""We're hearing reports from clinicians all over the country who are seeing more and more younger people with the cancer."" An increasing number of patients are men in their 50's and even 40's, he said, rather than in their 60's, as had previously been the case.
Institute researchers are preparing a nationwide study of esophageal cancer to see if they can figure out why it is rising, what causes it, and who with Barrett's condition will develop the fullblown malignancy. Among the possible risk factors they will explore are diet and exercise habits, medications taken and genetic predisposition. White, Wealthy and at Risk

For decades preceding her death, a bottle of milk of magnesia was her steady companion because she suffered daily from heartburn, now known as gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD. But many years passed before a link was clearly established between chronic irritation of the esophagus by stomach acid and this usually fatal cancer.
Now that the role of acid reflux is well known in cancer risk and unpleasant conditions like chronic cough and hoarseness, drug companies market several products, prescription and over the counter, that are far better able to control the backup of stomach acid than milk of magnesia. And gastroenterologists now know to be on the alert for early signs of trouble among patients who suffer from GERD.
The cancer that results from chronic reflux is preceded by a benign condition called Barrett’s esophagus, a cellular abnormality of the esophageal lining that can become precancerous. If untreated, about 10 percent of patients with Barrett’s esophagus eventually develop esophageal cancer, the nation’s fastest-growing cancer. In the last four decades, the annual number of new cases has risen 300 to 500 percent.

Two studies published this month in the journal Gastroenterology suggest that people who drink wine, white or red, in moderation are less likely to develop conditions that may lead to esophageal adenocarcinoma, an uncommon cancer that has increased sharply in the United States over the past 30 years.
The reports are particularly surprising because alcohol intake is a well-established risk factor for the other main form of esophageal cancer, squamous cell carcinoma. Researchers noted the studies were preliminary.
In one study, researchers at Kaiser Permanente in Oakland, Calif., found that drinking a glass of wine a day was associated with a more than 50 percent reduction in the risk of developing Barrett’s esophagus, though there was no reduction in risk among adults who drank liquor or beer. Barrett’s esophagus, an erosion of the esophageal lining that can be caused by chronic heartburn or acid reflux, increases the odds of developing esophageal adenocarcinoma 30-fold to 40-fold.",2009-03-04 19:22:38,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,barrett esophagus
78,"Chronic Heartburn Can Increase Risk of Esophagus Cancer, Study Shows","Reflux disease results not from an excess of stomach acid but from improper functioning of the muscular sphincter that separates the esophagus from the stomach. When functioning normally, Dr. Henry P. Parkman explained, this sphincter opens only when a person swallows and otherwise remains tightly contracted to prevent the acidic contents of the stomach from rising back up into the esophagus.
Dr. Parkman and his colleague, Dr. Sidney Cohen, both gastroenterologists at Temple University School of Medicine in Philadelphia, said in an editorial accompanying the new report that ''heartburn must be given respect.'' They urged early evaluation and aggressive treatment of severe heartburn to allow the damaged esophageal lining to heal and remain healthy.
The Swedish study compared the occurrence of chronic heartburn in 189 patients with esophageal adenocarcinoma and 262 patients with carcinoma of the gastric cardia, the uppermost part of the stomach, with the incidence of heartburn among 820 people without cancer and 167 patients with a second form of esophageal cancer called squamous cell carcinoma, which is linked to heavy alcohol use and cigarette smoking.
The research team, headed by Dr. Jesper Lagergren of the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, found that when patients with ''recurrent symptoms of reflux'' were compared with people without these symptoms, the likelihood of a diagnosis of esophageal adenocarcinoma was increased by 770 percent and the likelihood of adenocarcinoma of the gastric cardia was doubled. There was no relationship between reflux and squamous cell carcinoma, which represents nearly half of esophageal cancers.
But, researchers reported, ''the more frequent, more severe and longer lasting the symptoms of reflux,'' the greater the risk of a diagnosis of esophageal adenocarcinoma. Thus, among those with longstanding and severe symptoms of reflux, the risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma was raised by 4,350 percent and the risk of adenocarcinoma of the cardia was raised by 440 percent.
Among study participants, the researchers did not find any benefit of treatment of reflux disease. But they noted that most patients were treated only briefly or sporadically and sometimes were given drugs like anticholinergic drugs that have since been found to increase gastroesophageal reflux.
Dr. Parkman said that virtually all patients who eventually develop esophageal adenocarcinoma first develop a condition called Barrett's esophagus in which the lining cells become abnormal in response to their chronic acid bath. He suggested that patients with Barrett's esophagus should be examined every one to three years with an endoscope, and if precancerous cells are found corrective treatment can be instituted.
For patients with chronic reflux, Dr. Parkman and Dr. Cohen said that drug treatment should be administered continuously and indefinitely to reduce the risk of Barrett's esophagus. Dr. Parkman said drugs that are especially effective include Pepcid, Zantac, Tagamet and Axid, which are histamine-2 receptor antagonists that block histamine, one of the triggers of acid secretion in the stomach. Even more effective, he said, may be Prilosec and Prevacid, which are proton-pump inhibitors that block the final pathway of acid secretion and thus are effective against every trigger of acid release.",1999-03-18 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,barrett esophagus

Precancerous changes in the esophagus develop in 10 percent to 15 percent of patients with chronic heartburn, and these patients face a risk of cancer that is 30 to 40 times as great as the risk in the general population.
Heartburn is obviously a disease that demands more respect than it gets.
The widely publicized findings, which were published in The New England Journal of Medicine, precipitated countless thousands of inquiries from concerned patients, most of whom were already being treated by specialists, according to a survey of doctors by the American College of Gastroenterology.
But at least half the people who suffer from chronic heartburn are not getting the kind of medical care that may protect them from the serious consequences found in the Swedish study.
Heartburn results when the acidic contents of the stomach back up into the esophagus, often because of a weakness in the muscular valve between the esophagus and the stomach and sometimes because the contents of the stomach empty too slowly into the intestines. Patients with a hiatal hernia, in which a part of the stomach bulges through a weak area of the diaphragm, may also have a problem with heartburn.
In medical terms, and now in advertisements as well, chronic heartburn is called gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD. Symptoms can include a burning feeling in the chest, a sour taste in the mouth, regurgitation of a small amount of partly digested food, unexplained chest pain, asthma (especially at night), chronic hoarseness, sore throat or cough and erosion of the teeth.

He was 78 years old.
He died of cancer of the esophagus, said his son-in-law, Gary La Rue, with whom he lived in North Tarrytown in recent years.

In the late 1940's and early 50's, he spent five years as a literary journalist and associate editor of Partisan Review, which was then among the most important and influential literary and political journals in the United States.

86,Ultrasound and Fury: One Mother's Ordeal,"They also criticize the skills of those who did the scans in the study, complaining that too many birth defects were missed and thus many chances to make a difference in outcome were likewise missed. For example, if a fetus is found to have gastroschisis, in which the bowels protrude through a hole in the abdomen, the newborn has a much better chance of surviving and thriving if it is delivered in the same hospital where the corrective surgery will be performed, rather than having to being moved.
But Dr. Ewigman and others respond that such defects are too rare to justify automatic screening policies, and that the happy stories are more than countered by drawbacks. False positives like mine are said to be very rare, yet without trying I learned of three other women whose fetuses were incorrectly diagnosed as having clubfeet. And while these mistakes were joyfully resolved, false positives can have devastating outcomes. Dr. Horger cited the case of a woman who received an ultrasound diagnosis that her fetus had no kidneys, a fatal condition. She aborted the fetus at 18 weeks, and an autopsy revealed apparently normal kidneys.
More often women receive murky results that are difficult to interpret, but that offer just enough substance to nourish anxiety. During several scans performed in her third pregnancy, a neighbor of mine was told that her baby might have a serious kidney defect. There was nothing to do but wait and worry. Months later, she gave birth to a healthy daughter. Another acquaintance, who is still pregnant, was told after a sonogram that her fetus's eyes were unusually close together. She asked her doctors what it meant and what she should do about it. They did not know, and they suggested more scans. She refused. ''So maybe the baby will look like Lyle Lovett,'' she said, maintaining her humor but clearly worried.
Dr. Sheryl Burt Ruzek, a professor of health education at Temple University, said the rampant use of ultrasound ''has created false expectations that by having repeated screenings we can improve the likelihood of a good outcome of pregnancy.'' It gives the illusion of perfectability, but like most medical assays, ultrasound is imperfect. It can find problems where none exist, and, more often, it misses defects that exist. More than half of all defects have been shown to go unnoticed by ultrasound. ''The search for the perfect child is making women very anxious about reproducing,'' Dr. Ruzek said. An unfortunate byproduct of expecting perfection is the urge to sue upon arrival of an imperfect baby. Dr. Horger said one of the commonest causes of obstetrical lawsuits is the failure of a doctor to pick up a birth defect on ultrasound. Although the Radius study indicates that early detection of most abnormalities does not do much good anyway, doctors end up screening just to cover their afts.
A particular problem with ultrasound is that while women know that amniocentesis and most prenatal tests are designed to look for defects, they approach their sonogram with optimism. ''They're persuaded they'll be reassured, and will get their first picture of the baby,'' said Dr. Gail Geller, a bioethicist at Johns Hopkins University. ''But the physician's training is to find something that might be wrong. There's a cognitive dissonance between practitioners and patients.'' Indeed, she said, ''physicians can sound almost excited when they find something.'' That happened to us, with the doctor who murmured appreciatively, ''Good catch.''
In the end, many researchers said that women should be entitled to have ultrasound and other prenatal tests, but that the process of informed consent must be taken far more seriously than it currently is. Women should be told in detail of the limitations of screening, and of the fact that clinical studies show no benefit to scanning during a normal pregnancy, Dr. Geller said. Nor is it clear that doctors should bother ferreting out every minor aberration -- every cleft lip, every excess finger.
We still do not know why our daughter's foot appeared clubbed on three sonograms when it was not. The ultrasound specialists who gave us the final, definitive diagnosis said they stood by their original call and suggested the foot may have corrected itself during the later stages of pregnancy.
I am skeptical. I think this is a case of ambiguity prematurely corseted into certainty, and of insufficient data on all the possible variations of a normal fetal foot (not to mention any other body part) at 20 weeks gestation. I think my child has inherited her mother's unusually supple feet, which can point and twist in many directions and even mimic a clublike contortion. Perhaps my daughter was dreaming that she was a ballerina, flexing her foot into en pointe position, and preparing to dance the dance.",1996-11-26 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,gastroschisis
87,"Rate of Birth Defect of Abdominal Wall Increasing, C.D.C. Says","A serious birth defect is appearing in maternity wards with increasing frequency, and experts do not know why, federal researchers reported on Thursday.
Infants with the defect, called gastroschisis, are born with intestines poking out of a hole in the abdominal wall. Other organs, like the stomach and liver, may also be found outside the body at birth.
The prevalence of gastroschisis has increased by about 30 percent, to 4.9 births out of 10,000 during the period from 2006 to 2012, from 3.6 per 10,000 live births from 1995 to 2005, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
The defect occurs more often in babies born to mothers younger than 20, although the rate has increased among mothers of all ages. Young white mothers give birth to babies with the defect more than young women of other races: 18.1 per 10,000 live births, compared with 16.1 for Hispanic mothers and 10.2 for black mothers.",2016-01-21 20:46:45,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,gastroschisis
88,Surgery Lit by Cellphone: Togo Doctors Strike Over Deplorable Hospitals,"LOMÉ, Togo — The air-conditioner was broken in the sweltering neonatal ward of Togo’s largest hospital, and only one nurse was on duty to attend to the two dozen infants with life-threatening conditions.
Mothers with babies in the ward were imploring friends and family for loans to buy basic medical supplies from pharmacies around Lomé, the capital, because items like drugs, saline solution, latex gloves and packets of clean water were not available at Sylvanus Olympio University Teaching Hospital.
One infant, Tresor Tsolenyanou, was born in February with gastroschisis, a condition in which the intestines are partly exposed through a hole in the abdominal muscles. He shared a crib with several other babies, his bulging torso wrapped in gauze.
In the United States, the survival rate for gastroschisis is 90 percent. But because of the high risk of infection in this overcrowded, understaffed and undersupplied hospital, Tresor was likely to die, said Steven Kagni, the ward’s attending nurse.",2018-04-07 09:30:04,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,gastroschisis
89,Opioids May Play a Role in Congenital Problems,"Women who take codeine, oxycodone and other opioid pain drugs early in pregnancy may be exposing their babies to a higher risk of birth defects, a new study suggests.
Though the overall numbers were small, babies whose mothers took opioids were considerably more likely than others to have congenital problems, including a potentially fatal syndrome in which the left part of the heart does not develop completely; spina bifida; and gastroschisis, in which the intestines stick out of the body.
The study, from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, was one of the largest to examine the effects of opioid use during pregnancy. It appeared last month in The American Journal of Obstetrics & Gynecology.
It used data from the National Birth Defects Prevention Study about mothers in 10 states who gave birth from 1997 to 2005.",2011-03-17 21:14:28,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,gastroschisis

91,F.D.A. Bars Marketing of Supplements to Pregnant Women,"Under pressure from experts in birth defects, the Food and Drug Administration today withdrew, at least for now, a new rule that allowed dietary supplements to be sold for common pregnancy-related conditions like morning sickness and leg swelling.
Unlike drugs, supplements do not require rigorous testing for safety and efficacy, and the new F.D.A. rule, which took effect on Monday, drew fire from birth defects experts, who said it would put unborn babies at risk.
In response, the agency today told supplement manufacturers that their products could not ''make any claims related to pregnancy'' until officials had time to examine the issue. Dr. Janet Woodcock, director of the agency's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, said that the F.D.A. would convene a public hearing and that the outcome might be a revision of the rule.

92,"A New Orleans Home Is Reborn, With Persistence","In a city that still seems largely stuck in the mud, this nearly restored home represents 11 months of sweat-drenched labor by its owners, Artie Folse and Tonja Osborne, two of a multitude of New Orleans residents who never stopped pushing ahead.
From the earliest weeks after the storm, Mr. Folse and Ms. Osborne defied the conventional wisdom that little could be accomplished in the city, and overcame the doubts and worries even of their own families. Their efforts, observed since last winter by a reporter for The New York Times, were born of an urge to rebuild that is as primal as the force that pushes grass up through cracks in a sidewalk. Rather than wait for advice, direction or help from the city, the state or the federal governments, Mr. Folse and Ms. Osborne simply got to work.
“If you’re waiting for someone to tell you what to do, it’ll never happen,” Mr. Folse said.
The future of New Orleans, whatever it turns out to be, will be grounded in the stubborn drive of people like Artie Folse and Tonja Osborne, who can be found in every neighborhood of this city. There are many, of course, who lack their resources or skills, who suffered devastating human losses or who have succumbed to despair.
But some 30,000 houses are now being repaired or rebuilt around town, according to planners and city officials, and work will begin on tens of thousands more this fall when federal housing aid begins to flow. Those who try to rebuild do so with no guarantee of success, minimal encouragement from government and a willful faith their collective labors can actually change that future.

Researchers from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said their study also confirmed a link between pre-pregnancy obesity and neural tube birth defects, including spina bifida.
Compared with women whose weight is considered normal, the study found, those who were obese or overweight before pregnancy faced double the risk of having babies with heart defects and double the risk of multiple birth defects.
The study also found that obese women were more than three times as likely as other women to have babies with a defect known as omphalocele, in which intestines or other abdominal organs protrude through the navel.",2003-05-05 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,omphalocele

96,SCIENCE WATCH; Birth Risk of Nausea Drug,"Numerous studies have explored the suggestion that the antinausea drug Bendectin, when taken during early pregnancy, increases the risk of birth defects. The results have been inconsistent, with some studies indicating a possible cause-and-effect relationship between Bendectin use and certain malformations and others showing such no such link.
The issue is of major concern because about three million prescriptions are written for this drug each year, and about one in 10 pregnant women takes it.
Now, two researchers from the Yale University School of Medicine say the conflicting results arose because of flaws and inconsistencies in the designs of previous studies. They conducted their own study of 1,427 women who bore malformed infants and 3,001 women whose babies were normal at birth, attempting to avoid the pitfalls of prior studies.
According to their findings, published in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Bendectin users faced a significantly increased risk of bearing babies with a digestive tract abnormality called pyloric stenosis. This defect, which is correctable by surgery, involves a constriction between the stomach and intestines that impedes passage of food, resulting in frequent forceful vomiting and, if prolonged, malnutrition. A possible association between Bendectin use in early pregnancy and heart valve abnormalities in the newborn was also noted, as well as a suggested link to cleft lip and palate and limb reductions.",1983-01-04 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,pyloric stenosis
97,Anesthesia in Infants Linked to Allergy,"WASHINGTON, Jan. 21—Receiving general anesthesia during the first two of lifeing the first two years of life may be a factor in predisposing children to develop asthma or hay fever, a team of specialists told a medical meeting today.
One of the specialists who made this discovery said he considered it a strong argument against “elective” major surgery in very young children. The term “elective” suggests that the surgery needs to be done but that there is no immediate threat to life and, therefore, the surgeon may choose the timing to the best advantage of the patient.
Analyzing the medical experience of a group of children in Rochester, the team found that 60 per cent of those who received general anesthesia before the age of 2 had developed an allergy, as compared with about 12 per cent among children who had not undergone surgery in that age period.

The agency said it was still recommending erythromycin as the treatment of choice for newborns with whooping cough.
The centers said a hospital in Knoxville, Tenn., prescribed erythromycin to 200 babies born there in February after they were exposed to whooping cough. Seven of the newborns became ill with pyloric stenosis, in which a muscle at the bottom of the stomach enlarges, blocking food from passing to the small intestine.

99,The Lives They Loved,"The love of my life. My hi school sweetheart. Married 38yrs. Together forever. Born with pyloric stenosis in 1958 she was saved when surgery was performed at 28 days old. I noticed her in 7th grade and became increasingly aware of her and by the 10th grade we were in love. We were 15, our parents said we were to young to be so serious but we didn’t listen. We dated through hi school and at the ripe old age of 19 on September 11 1977 we were wed. We had already discussed our life ambitions by the time we married and they were simple. We wanted to love each other forever, have some babies and let the circle of life unfold before our eyes. And we made love. Often. In 1979 she gave birth to our firstborn. A son. In 1981 a second son. She was happy with the two boys and we decided that two was going to be enough. The following years were happy ones with her gladly accepting the role of den mother, cub scout leader and sporting event Mom. The boys quickly grew into teens and their attention turned to girls. They often sought their mothers advice when it came to relationships and matters of the heart. In 2004 the oldest son married and Darilyns empty nest years were filled with dreams of grandbabies. When the first grandchild was born she finally got the daughter she never had. A brand new baby girl granddaughter. Another, a sister followed and at the same time Darilyn was diagnosed with severe rhuemetoid arthritis in 2007. It was then her life changed. The next years were a lot of Doctors, medicine and pain management. She maintained a somewhat normal life and 2 more grandchildren joined her family. A grandson and another little girl. She told me about a year ago she felt her life was complete. That she accomplished everything we ever set out to do and that she was the happiest woman on earth. Six months later on August 18 2015 she was diagnosed with lung cancer. In the 3rd stage of chemo her lung collapsed. She died 8 days later on November 21. Gone but never forgotten.

100,How I Solved the Gender Labor Imbalance,"I told myself I would never fall down the “wife trap rabbit hole.”
My mother and father both worked outside the home, but like many women of their generation, my mother was in charge of keeping the home and caring for the children on top of her paying job. When my boyfriend and I moved in together, I made sure not to take over the housekeeping. We both cooked and cleaned and knew how to operate the washing machine. Home maintenance was either a joint effort or jointly neglected.
Like so many egalitarian efforts, our domestic parity was lost once we had a baby. Everyone probably has a story of how it happened to them. In our case, my husband fell into a depression. On top of that, our 2-week-old baby needed surgery for a stomach condition called pyloric stenosis, and he came out of the operation weak and underweight. Along with the love I gave him, I went into a tough-broad-who-gets-everything-done mode. But I never came out of it.
And so our patterns formed. I took care of the baby. I took care of the house. As my son grew older, I managed everything: food, medical appointments, preschool reconnaissance, after-school activities, birthdays and wardrobe and transportation. We had a second child and we constantly renegotiated the terms of our labor division because neither of us wanted to be stuck in those stereotypical roles. But though my husband had emerged from his depression and I from my tough broad mode, we never got our gender equality groove back despite our efforts.
Then, two years ago, my husband took a job in Luxembourg, where the lingua franca is French. He’s fluent in French, whereas on a good day, I speak it like a 5-year-old. Suddenly, the entire dynamic between us changed.",2018-02-06 11:00:01,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,pyloric stenosis
101,The Lives They Loved,"My dad broke rules. The story I’ve been told about the first time my dad met my mom’s mom, Jessie, the mother of his then girlfriend, was that he was laying on her couch with his feet up on the armrest and as my grandmother walked into the room, he stayed in that position as he greeted her for the first time. It was 1963. Jessie was not impressed. But she grew to love him as did many people who got to know him throughout his life. My dad made friends everywhere — in his stores, in the elevator, on the street, in Indonesia, in restaurants and in the hospital. Often, at first, people would not know what to make of him with his dry sense of humor that skirted the boundaries of polite interaction. But beyond the crass humor, he got real with people. He was curious about peoples’ lives and intrigued by the differences and similarities among us. He was incredibly generous, pushy, encouraging and reflective. He cried at family milestones — in public, usually without tissues and with mucus. He expressed anger and love in big ways. He questioned expectations and railed against constraints. He was creative and silly. He solved problems by truly thinking outside the box. He worked hard at all hours of the day and night while making it seem like there was no other way to be in the world. He was always available to do favors, find solutions and talk on the phone. Unless he was asleep. Even before he got sick, he could fall asleep no matter what was going on around him. My dad expressed his appreciation of the good in people by saying that with all that could go wrong between people, it was amazing how much actually went well.
And he was all these ways as a dad too. He encouraged me to see beyond conventions and consider possibilities that might not be readily apparent. Once, my dad decided that the best way to teach me the parts of speech was to invent an entire new language with me. We made up pronouns and developed conjugations for the verbs. Our word for love was “smoochy.” And “I love you” was, “Ah smoochy kah.” We kept that phrase in use over the years.

103,The Lives They Loved,"My mother was the only person I have ever met who did not judge others: no one, ever. At the informal memorial we held for her last week, it was something most people mentioned, together with her ability to make everyone she spoke with feel valued. Despite having grown up in small towns in the Midwest, the daughter of a minister, she had an extraordinarily open mind when it came to taking on the world. In 1955, during her last year of nursing school in Chicago, she met and fell in love with my father, who had been a patient at the hospital where she was training. Not only was he a Spanish/Mexican American, he had also just accepted a job as an architect in Spain. Several months later she sailed across the Atlantic, rendezvoused with him in Tangiers, where they were married, and then settled in Madrid, where they lived for several years. Thus began a lifetime of living overseas. Over the next 50 years they lived in Venezuela, Thailand, Kuwait, Mexico, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, the Philippines, and in the US in New York, Boston, L.A., the Bay Area and finally a tiny town in the gold country of the Sierra foothills known as Rescue. Unlike many expats, they never lived in compounds, and made a point of learning as much as they could about the peoples and cultures of the different places they lived. People would often ask my mother which country she had enjoyed the most, and she never knew how to respond as she had loved living in each of those countries and had such wonderful experiences in all of them.
I was five when we moved to Thailand and it was an extraordinary experience for many reasons, but perhaps most importantly because my parents taught us through their own actions of the importance of respecting all cultures equally and never assuming one was superior to another. As a professor I have spent the last 20 odd years teaching American students and students overseas (primarily in the Middle East) about cultures and societies very different than their own. Occasionally a challenge, but always an extraordinarily rewarding experience.

104,"A Country Gentleman's Broadway Visits; Or, How a Kentucky Colonel Assembles a Summer Stock Cast","In that respect, things have changed very little over the years Colonel Henson has been coming to town.
In 1969, for example, he hired an ambitious teen-ager from Englewood, N.J., named John Travolta, who spoke his first theatrical lines at the Playhouse. (The play, written by Colonel Henson himself, was about a Kentucky doctor who pioneered abdominal surgery. Mr. Travolta's first lines were: ''Yes. Margaret Miller was suffering from pyloric stenosis and at the time of the operation I had no chance of success!'')
But as part George M. Cohan, part Lee Strasberg, part used-car salesman, Colonel Henson is also one of a dying breed. In its heyday in the 1930's and 1940's, hundreds of little theaters made up the so-called straw-hat circuit, and the plucky ''Let's put on a show in a barn!'' esthetic entered American culture.
Gene Kelly and Judy Garland did it in the movie ''Summer Stock.'' In ''The Big Laugh,'' John O'Hara's novel about 1930's Hollywood, a future film icon, Hubie Ward, gets his start with the fictional East Sandwich Players on Cape Cod.
''Does it pay well?'' Hubie asks a friend.
''Does it pay well?'' she replies. ''Pays nothing. But we get room and board and a chance to act in some very good plays. The best kind of experience for somebody just starting out.''
Colonel Henson offers a lot of experience and a little pay -- $200 a week for principal actors; $50 a week for people who will mostly work on the technical side but can try out for small parts; room and board for those he calls apprentices, who can also try out. He says he has never made a dime from the theater and in fact has kept it alive with hundreds of thousands of dollars from rental properties that he and his wife, Charlotte, operate.
''A lot of people ask me, 'Colonel, why do you do it?' '' he said between auditions. Then another actor came in, and he never got back around to what he tells them.",1999-04-23 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,pyloric stenosis

107,Two Win Nobel Prize for Discovering Bacterium Tied to Stomach Ailments,"After Dr. Marshall and Dr. Warren discovered the role of the spiral-shaped H. pylori bacterium, they and others conducted trials showing that antibiotics and drugs inhibiting the production of stomach acid could cure gastritis and most stomach and duodenal ulcers.
The inflammation produced by H. pylori can also lead to certain stomach cancers that seem to be prevented by antibiotic treatment of the bacterium. In the early 1900's, stomach cancer was a leading cause of cancer deaths in the United States. But its incidence fell significantly, for unknown reasons, before the discovery of H. pylori's role. Stomach cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer deaths worldwide.
H. pylori is also an important player in a type of lymphoma cancer of the stomach known as MALT, for mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue. Such lymphomas usually regress when antibiotics rid the stomach of H. pylori. Since the late 1800's, many doctors had noted the bacterium's presence in the stomachs of patients with ulcers and gastritis, but they ignored the connection.
In the early 1980's, Dr. Warren noted the bacterium in the lower part of the stomach in about half of the patients who had biopsies. He made a crucial observation that signs of inflammation were always present in the surface lining of the stomach near where he observed the bacterium.
Dr. Marshall joined Dr. Warren in studying biopsies from a series of patients. After several attempts, Dr. Marshall succeeded in growing a bacterium that was unknown then; he named it Campylobacter pyloridis, believing that it was a member of the Campylobacter family. (It was later found to be a member of the Helicobacter family and renamed H. pylori.)
Still, many doctors were unconvinced by the findings, a point recognized by the Nobel committee, which said the award went to Dr. Marshall and Dr. Warren ""who with tenacity and a prepared mind challenged prevailing dogmas.""
Dr. Marshall carried on a medical tradition in experimenting on himself to test his and Dr. Warren's theory and to show that Helicobacter was the primary cause of gastritis, not a secondary invader.",2005-10-04 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,gastritis
108,NEW BACTERIUM LINKED TO PAINFUL STOMACH ILLS,"The excitement this time centers on a spiral-shaped bacterium that Dr. Barry J. Marshall and Dr. J. Robin Warren in Perth have detected in a study of 100 patients suffering from an inflammatory stomach condition known as gastritis and from stomach ulcers. The researchers detected the bacterium in 58 of the patients. It was identified in 27 of 31, or 87 percent, of patients who had a gastric or duodenal ulcer, and in 38 of 40, or 95 percent of patients with pathological evidence of active gastritis. The bacteria were detected on biopsies of stomach obtained through a gastroscope. When such biopsies were studied under a microscope, the bacterium were mostly seen beneath the mucus, which apparently protects it against the hydrochloric acid produced by the stomach.
The new bacteria resemble the S-shaped ones that belong to the genus Campylobacter. But an important difference is that whereas Campylobacter have at most one slender projection known as a flagellum emerging from one end of the S, the newly discovered organisms have up to four flagella. The resemblance to Campylobacter is a reminder of how with time and new knowledge doctors change their minds about the importance of certain microorganisms. About half a century passed from 1909 when Campylobacter were discovered in animals until doctors linked them to human disease. In the past decade, however, Cambylobacter have been recognized increasingly as a cause of such disease. There are two main types, C. jejuni and C. intestinalis, that cause distinctly different human conditions. C. jejuni is one of the most commonly recognized causes of diarrhea throughout the world; C. intestinalis generally affects only debilitated adults with serious chronic diseases.
Speaking of the Australian bacterium, Dr. George Buck, a microbiologist at the University of Texas at Galveston, said, ''It definitely is a new organism.'' He also said that he believed ''it is a new genus, but it is hard to say that without definitive genetic studies, and they have not been done yet.'' Dr. Buck said his opinion was based on comparisons of samples he and the Australians have sent each other. Dr. Buck's findings add to the reports that have come from several research teams in England, the Netherlands, Scotland and West Germany confirming the existence of the spiral stomach bacterium.
The editors of The Lancet, which is published in London and in which most of the reports have appeared, said that proof of the theory would make the Australian work ''very important indeed.'' Such proof might come from attempts to infect animals. However, researchers have been hindered by the lack of a good animal model for chronic ulcers so that if animals fed the organism do not develop ulcers or gastritis, the negative findings may not be significant.
Researchers may have to seek proof from various long-term epidemiologic, pathologic and other studies on humans, according to one researcher, Dr. Robert M. Donaldson Jr., a Yale medical professor. ''It would take a long time - my guess is a decade - to provide really convincing evidence'' of the infectious cause, he said. Even then, Dr. Donaldson added, he seriously doubts the infectious theory ''would pan out.'' One test is the response of patients to antibiotic therapy. Dr. Marshall contended that by adding a bismuth containing drug and antibiotics to the standard treatment regimen for ulcers and gastritis, and then documenting the disappearance of the bacteria, he had prevented relapses of the ailments.",1984-07-31 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,gastritis
109,HEALTH; Physicians Pin Ulcers on New Suspect: A Germ,"'Important New Development'
''Helicobacter pylori is the most important new development in ulcer disease,'' said Dr. David Graham, chief of gastroenterology at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Houston, a former skeptic who is now largely convinced.
Today, most researchers say that Helicobacter infection is a precondition for ulcer formation and that patients who do not carry the organism will never fall victim to ulcers, even if they smoke or drink or worry.
Bitter debate continues over whether the bacterium is a cause or just a co-factor, and especially over which patients should be treated with the current crude recipe for antibiotic therapy, which is complicated, not always effective and can have some uncomfortable side effects.
Dr. Graham said that the antibiotic treatment for ulcers had not been perfected and that it was premature for doctors to dispense antibiotics for the disease except as part of a research trial.
'A Long Way to Go'
But some gastroenterologists offer antibiotics to office patients with frequently recurring ulcers and Dr. Marshall, for one, applauds the trend. ''Specialists should be looking for the bacterium and treating it in patients who have ulcer problems,'' he said. ''Only about 10 percent are doing that now. The tide is turning, but there's a long way to go.''",1990-04-26 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,gastritis
110,What Was Causing a Healthy Older Man to Be Nauseated by Food?,"“Dad, you have to come home, right away,” the woman said calmly but insistently on the phone to her 73-year-old father. He and her mother had just embarked on a two-week European vacation with close friends, but he told his daughter that he had never felt this sick. It frightened her that this man, who was in excellent health, competed in triathlons and whose stoicism was a family joke, felt bad enough to call her from France to tell her how the very smell of food nauseated him. Eating, he said, was even worse. For days, he hadn’t been able to do much more than nibble the bread and sip the water and try to pretend that he was having a good time. He and his wife had been looking forward to this post-retirement trip for so long that he couldn’t bear to ruin it. But he wasn’t sure he could make it to the end.
The daughter, an emergency-room physician, knew that a few days before this trip, her father hadn’t been feeling great — he was nauseated, especially after eating. When he called her then, she worried that he was having a heart attack. But he went to a local walk-in clinic, and his EKG was normal. There was no sign that it was his heart. The clinic sent him home with a prescription for an antacid and a medication for nausea and told him that he might be getting an ulcer. Relieved by the test results, his daughter gave her blessing for this trip. But the pills hadn’t done much, and now she knew that he had to come home to figure out what was wrong.
Surprising Weight Loss
She arranged for her parents to travel directly from the airport to the emergency department of the Yale New Haven Hospital, where she worked. She had already asked one of her most respected colleagues to see her father. Although her father told her that he wasn’t able to eat much since the nausea started, she was still shocked by his appearance. He’d lost about 15 pounds over the past couple of weeks. His clothes looked at least a size too big, and his eyes seemed to have retreated deep into his skull. To her, everything about him shouted that he was sick.
In the emergency room, he was seen promptly. Tubes of blood were drawn. He wasn’t anemic; there was no sign of infection; it wasn’t a heart attack; his kidneys and liver were fine. A CT scan didn’t show any abnormalities other than a small hiatal hernia. After a few hours, the doctor admitted defeat. He couldn’t find anything wrong with the man. Perhaps, someone suggested, retirement wasn’t agreeing with him. His daughter dismissed the notion immediately. She sent her parents home, knowing that her father had an appointment with his primary-care doctor the next day. Her father had known this doctor for decades. He was a great internist and would figure it out, she was sure.",2018-06-13 09:00:01,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,gastritis
111,"The Damage of Reflux (Bile, Not Acid)","No one with bile reflux needs to just wait for worse to come, although the remedies are not as simple and well known as they are for acid reflux. The condition usually can be managed with medications, but severe cases may require surgery.
Image
Symptoms and Causes
Both acid reflux and bile reflux may afflict the same person, which can make diagnosis a challenge. But the stomach inflammation that results from bile reflux often causes a burning or gnawing pain in the upper abdomen that is not felt with acid reflux, according to experts at the Mayo Clinic. Other symptoms of bile reflux may include frequent heartburn (the main symptom of acid reflux), nausea, vomiting bile, sometimes a cough or hoarseness and unintended weight loss.
A brief anatomy lesson makes the problem easier to understand. The main organs of the digestive tract are separated by valvelike tissues that, when functioning properly, allow food and digestive fluids to pass in only one direction: down. Thus, as food and liquids pass through the digestive process, they normally travel from the mouth to the throat, then down the esophagus into the stomach, and finally into the small intestine. The opening between the esophagus and stomach, a muscular ring called the lower esophageal sphincter, is meant to keep stomach acid from backing up. When it malfunctions, acid reflux  chronic heartburn  is the usual result.
Likewise, the pyloric valve, the muscular ring between the stomach and small intestine, is supposed to open just enough to permit a fraction of an ounce of liquefied food to pass into the small intestine, but not enough to allow bile to back up into the stomach. When this valve fails to close properly, refluxed bile can cause gastritis, an irritation and inflammation of the stomach lining. Untreated, that can result in a bleeding ulcer or even stomach cancer.
If the esophageal sphincter malfunctions at the same time, or there is a build-up of pressure in the stomach, bile and acid can reach the lower portion of the esophagus, inflaming the delicate lining of this organ. If the problem persists, it can cause scarring that narrows the esophagus, which may result in choking, or the cellular abnormality called Barrett’s esophagus, which can become precancerous and eventually develop into cancer that is nearly always fatal.
Gastroenterologists have recently demonstrated that Barrett’s esophagus can often be effectively treated with radiofrequency therapy, which might help patients like Mrs. Kozma.
Bile reflux can occur as a complication of certain surgeries, like the gallbladder surgery Mrs. Kozma underwent. More often, though, damage to the pyloric valve results from gastric surgery  total removal of the stomach or the gastric bypass operation used to treat morbid obesity.",2009-06-29 20:53:36,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,gastritis

Stomach cancer is the second most-common cancer in the world, after lung cancer.
Previous research has strongly linked the bacterium, Helicobacter pylori, to an inflammation of the stomach known as gastritis and to ulcers in the stomach and duodenum. Other studies have hinted that the bacterium might play a role in causing stomach cancer, but the strongest evidence comes from the studies being reported today in The New England Journal of Medicine.
H. pylori could be responsible for up to 60 percent of stomach cancers, according to the studies. They involved statistical comparisons of infection rates among those who did and did not develop stomach cancer in large studies in California and Hawaii. No Proof Is Seen

113,The Claim: Drinking Flat Soda Can Ease an Upset Stomach,"THE FACTS
It is not often that a soft drink is seen as medicinal. But when it comes to stomach distress, many people view a cup of flat soda as just what the doctor ordered.
The quick and popular remedy  usually in the form of cola, ginger ale or clear sodas  is said to help settle the stomach with its slight fizz and replenish fluids and glucose lost by vomiting and diarrhea. Parents also find that children who are verging on dehydration but reluctant to consume any liquids are more amenable to soda.

But research shows that may not be a great idea. In a recent study, British researchers conducted a review of the medical literature going back to the 1950s in search of scientific evidence supporting the claim. They found none. Then, after a biochemical analysis, they compared the contents of colas and other sodas with over-the-counter oral-rehydration solutions containing electrolytes and small amounts of sugar.",2008-06-03 04:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,gastritis
114,Vitamin B12 as Protection for the Aging Brain,"As a woman of a certain age who consumes a well-balanced diet of all the usual food groups, including reasonable amounts of animal protein, I tend to dismiss advice to take a multivitamin supplement. I’ve been told repeatedly by nutrition experts that the overuse of dietary supplements for “nutritional insurance” has given Americans the most expensive urine in the world.
I do take a daily supplement of vitamin D, based on considerable evidence of its multiple health benefits, especially for older people. However, based on advice from the National Academy of Medicine and an examination of accumulating research, I’m prompted to consider also taking a vitamin B12 supplement in hopes of protecting my aging brain.
Animal protein foods — meat, fish, milk, cheese and eggs — are the only reliable natural dietary sources of B12, and I do get ample amounts of several in my regular diet. But now at age 75, I wonder whether I’m still able to reap the full benefit of what I ingest.
You see, the ability to absorb B12 naturally present in foods depends on the presence of adequate stomach acid, the enzyme pepsin and a gastric protein called intrinsic factor to release the vitamin from the food protein it is attached to. Only then can the vitamin be absorbed by the small intestine. As people age, acid-producing cells in the stomach may gradually cease to function, a condition called atrophic gastritis.",2016-09-06 06:00:05,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,gastritis
115,6 Things I Learned About Ulcers,"Halfway through February, I could no longer sleep through the night. At 2 a.m., I’d find myself chugging milk from the carton to extinguish a fire at the top of my rib cage. The gnawing feeling high in my stomach alternated with nausea so arresting I kept a bucket next to my laptop and considered taking a pregnancy test, even though I was 99 percent sure I wasn’t expecting.
One day on the subway platform, I doubled over and let out a groan so pathetic it prompted a complete stranger to ask, “Are you all right?” Then I knew it was time to seek medical attention. New Yorkers don’t address strangers on the subway, I told myself. It’s like breaking the fourth wall.
The next day, my primary care doctor told me I probably had an ulcer, a raw spot or sore in the lining of the stomach or small intestine. Here are some of the things I learned about ulcers during the odyssey that followed.
■ Anyone can get an ulcer. Back in the 1980s, when doctors and most everyone else thought psychological stress or spicy foods led to ulcers, two Australian scientists discovered that the main culprit was actually a bacterium called Helicobacter pylori. That discovery eventually won them a Nobel Prize in 2005, and ushered in an era of using antibiotics to cure ulcers.",2017-04-13 09:45:02,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,ulcer
116,ULCER CASES AND SURGERY DECLINE; DRUG SEEMS TO CONTROL SEVERITY OF,"The introduction of cimetidine in the United States at the end of 1976 followed a 30 percent decline in the number of operations done for ulcers in this country over the preceding 12 years, according to a study reported recently in The Lancet, a medical journal, by Harvey V. Fineberg and Laurie A. Pearlman of the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston.
But in 1978, the first complete year after the introduction of cimetidine into the American market, there was a truly precipitous decline in ulcer surgery. The number of ulcer operations had dropped from 136,000 in 1966 to 97,000 in 1977, and then to 69,000 in 1978. It was the largest single decline of the decade. The number of operations rose to 81,000 in 1979, the latest for which figures are available.
Nevertheless, the figures for 1978 and 1979 were far below the rates predicted on the basis of the trend from 1966 to 1977, according to the Harvard researchers. They also said that ''for the decade before 1978, more than one in four patients admitted to hospital for peptic ulcer were operated on, and in 1978 the proportion dropped to below one in five.''
The Harvard team concluded that ''the evidence is circumstantial'' that the fall was due to cimetidine and that it ''depends in part on the absence of other plausible explanations.'' There was still need, they said, for corroborative evidence from similar studies in other countries.
One such supporting study, based on the statistics from six hospitals in Britain and Northern Ireland, was reported in the same issue of The Lancet. It found a 39 percent drop in the number of duodenal ulcer operations done for the five years before and four years after the introduction of cimetidine. region of the British National Health Service that showed a similar favorable trend.
Why? The authors suggested that the traditional indication for duodenal ulcer surgery was ''failed medical treatment'' and that cimetidine was offering better medical therapy. Others have offered an additional explanation: some patients with relapses prefer taking several pills a day than submit to an operation.
The Food and Drug Administration currently recommends the drug only for duodenal ulcers - not gastric ulcers - and for a rare condition called Zollinger-Ellison syndrome.",1981-07-28 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,ulcer

Dr. Boren said H. pylori attached itself to the antigen and then worked its way into the cell. This leads to a chronic infection and inflammation that has been associated with ulcers. The chronic infection has also been linked to stomach cancer, he said.
A report on the study is to be published Friday in the journal Science.

120,No One Can Control Runaway Medical Costs; Diagnosing Ulcers,"To the Editor:
Your Nov. 21 front page report on endorsement by Congressional conferees of Medicare price adjustments through expenditure targets perpetuates inaccuracies that have plagued this issue since the beginning. The studies of the merits and benefits of diagnosis and treatment procedures have been controversial since first released. Dr. William Hsiao (who is not a physician, but an economist), one of the fee system's developers, is easily confused by superficial similarities without a physician's appreciation of the subtle differences between techniques.
For example, you point out that Dr. Hsiao states that a $350 endoscopy diagnoses an ulcer no better than a $75 physical exam. This is patently ridiculous, even to a nonphysician. On a physical, one can infer the presence of an ulcer (as compared with any one of a number of other causes of ''stomach pain''), but no competent physician could stop there. An endo-scopy not only proves an ulcer, but also allows the physician to observe it, measure it, take bacterial cultures of it, take small biopsies for microscopic study.
If the ulcer is malignant, the future management will be quite different from what it would be if it is benign. Clearly, a physical exam would have to be followed by an endoscopy or a radiological investigation to define the nature of the ulcer.
The subtleties of modern medical science are not so reducible to formula as a supply-and-demand curve on the board in an economics classroom. ROBERT J. SCHECHTER, M.D. Los Angeles, Nov. 21, 1989",1989-12-13 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,ulcer
121,Antimicrobial Drugs Endorsed for Ulcers In a Major U.S. Shift,"The addition of antimicrobial therapy offers ulcer patients the promise of a full cure with one course of drug therapy. It also offers the possibility of fewer complications, like bleeding and blockage of the intestine from swelling and inflammation. Opportunity for Cure
""We now have an opportunity to cure a disease that previously we had only been able to suppress or control, and sometimes not all successfully,"" said Dr. Ann L. B. Williams of George Washington University Medical Center in Washington, a panel member.
In treating ulcers, doctors usually prescribe drugs to cut down on the production of stomach acid. The two principal drugs are Tagamet, made by SmithKline Beecham, and Zantac, made by Glaxo Holdings, both from the so-called H2 blocker group. A third drug, omeprazole, is from the acid pump inhibitor group. The drugs are prescribed for about eight weeks, and sometimes much longer. Doctors also prescribe antacids and agents to protect the lining of the stomach and duodenum.
The recommendation could have an important impact on the drug industry if antimicrobial therapy is widely adopted, as expected, and long-term use of drugs like Tagamet and Zantac are reduced. The news today, however, had little effect on the stock prices of SmithKline Beecham and Glaxo.
The panel recommended several combinations of antimicrobial drugs, including antibiotics. All are sold in the United States. But none have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of H. pylori or ulcers.
In its statement today, the panel said: ""Ulcer patients with H. pylori infection require treatment with antimicrobial agents in addition to antisecretory drugs."" By using the word ""require,"" the panel has raised a thorny issue for doctors and the Food and Drug Administration.
It is common for doctors to prescribe marketed drugs for nonapproved uses, a practice known as off-label prescribing. But the practice can leave doctors vulnerable to malpractice suits if a patient experiences a serious reaction.",1994-02-10 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,ulcer

Every year, about 200,000 people undergo the most common gastric bypass operation, known as Roux-en-Y, which causes significant weight loss and improvements in overall health.
To find out whether these effects could rub off, researchers at Stanford University recruited 35 people preparing to undergo the procedure and followed them and their families for a year, including their children. The relatives accompanied the patients to eight counseling sessions, where they learned about portion control and nutrition.
A year after the surgery, the patients had lost an average of 100 pounds and went from body mass indexes of 48.7 to 33.3 on average.

This fall, Michigan surgeons gathered about 100 bariatric surgery patients into small focus groups roughly a year after their operations and asked about their new lives, expecting mostly enthusiastic reports. Yet responses were muted.
“From an outsider’s perspective — as someone who hasn’t had the operation — it is confusing,” Dr. Ghaferi said. “Why on earth wouldn’t you be ecstatic?”
There was a lot of talk about changed relationships. Some patients had divorced or separated from a spouse. Some said that a partner did not like the way they looked, or that their partner was still obese and jealous, or that the partner complained, “You’re not the person I married.”
Some believed that people would judge them for having had the surgery, so they kept the operation a secret.
Some did not like the way they looked. It was not enough weight loss, or they were not aware — although it had been part of their presurgery education sessions — that they would end up with big flaps of loose skin that could be gotten rid of only with extensive and expensive plastic surgery.
On the other side of the equation, patients raved about newfound energy and stamina, and the way joint and back pain disappeared. They loved tossing away medications for diabetes or high blood pressure.

127,The Underused Weight Loss Option: Bariatric Surgery,"Although guidelines set in 1991 limit recommendations for bariatric surgery to those most severely affected by obesity, current evidence indicates that young people who are not yet morbidly obese may be especially likely to benefit from weight-loss surgery. Most adolescents who are obese remain obese as adults and have worse medical outcomes than people who became obese as adults. The surgical route is now sometimes offered to adolescents and young adults with obesity-related health problems like Type 2 diabetes that have failed to yield to diet and exercise.
In a study reported by the University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health that followed 2,221 patients, within three years of bariatric surgery, most experienced less pain and improved ability to walk. But as with any weight-loss program, such benefits as well as lasting weight management depend on whether patients stick to a healthful diet and exercise regimen after the surgery.
The original bariatric technique, called Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, reduces the stomach to the size of an egg and bypasses a major portion of the small intestine to limit caloric absorption. A now-retired friend who underwent this operation 15 years ago lost 160 pounds and has kept all but 10 pounds off despite traveling widely on vacations, a time when people often gain weight.
However, in recent years, gastric bypass has yielded to a newer, less involved operation called sleeve gastrectomy that has fewer complications yet excellent long-lasting results.
According to the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery, only 1.5 percent of patients undergoing sleeve gastrectomy require a reoperation because of complications, as against 7.7 percent undergoing gastric bypass and 15.3 percent who have a less effective procedure called lap band surgery, in which a band placed around the stomach divides it into two pouches.
In sleeve gastrectomy, about 85 percent of the stomach is removed, resulting in a banana-shaped pouch that limits the amount of food that can be consumed. In addition to restricting how much a person can eat, the surgery reduces hunger and the desire to overeat by eliminating the portion of the stomach that produces ghrelin, the hormone that stimulates appetite.
Both sleeve gastrectomy and gastric bypass, as well as other albeit less effective bariatric approaches, can be done laparoscopically, with patients spending only a day or two in the hospital.",2020-09-28 09:00:13,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,gastric
128,Gastric Band Surgery Results Disappoint Researchers,"More than a decade after having gastric band surgery for weight loss, patients at a university hospital in Belgium had lost just 43 percent of their excess weight on average, a new study reports. In nearly half of the patients, the bands had been removed because of medical complications.
Although the study included just 82 of 151 patients who had laparoscopic gastric band surgery at the hospital from 1994 to 1997, it is believed to be the first to track the outcomes over a long period. The report was published last week in Archives of Surgery.
The bands eroded in almost one in three patients, the researchers found. Sixty percent had undergone additional surgery, including 17 percent who went on to have gastric bypass. Researchers concluded that the adjustable gastric band surgery, which is growing in popularity in the United States, “appears to result in relatively poor long-term outcomes.”
The results “are worse than we expected,” said Dr. Jacques Himpens, of the European School of Laparoscopic Surgery and St. Pierre University Hospital in Brussels, lead author of the new study. Dr. Himpens advised those considering gastric band surgery not to “nourish exaggerated expectations,” adding that anyone who has had the procedure should see a care provider on a regular basis and be vigilant for signs of infection or band erosion.",2011-03-24 21:24:56,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,gastric
129,‘Take on an Empty Stomach.’ How Do You Know When Your Stomach Is Empty?,"In 1966, other investigators began using radioactive substances to measure gastric emptying. With refinements over the years, this technique has become the standard for assessing the rate of gastric emptying.
Standards for such testing have been set by the American Neurogastroenterology and Motility Society and the Society of Nuclear Medicine. They state that a normal stomach should be 90 percent empty after four hours. The difference between this standard and the earlier study probably reflects differences in foods. Solids take longer to digest than liquids; fats take longer to digest than protein or carbohydrates.
The Food and Drug Administration incorporates these data, standards and thousands of drug-food studies into actionable recommendations. The F.D.A. defines an empty stomach as “one hour before eating, or two hours after eating.” The F.D.A.’s two-hour rule is just a rule of thumb; the stomach will probably not be completely empty.
The specific definition of an empty stomach varies from drug to drug. The popular anti-osteoporosis drug Fosamax, for example, should be taken “at least one-half hour before the first food, beverage, or medication of the day.” This promotes its absorption and reflects the need to stay upright after taking Fosamax, which lessens its potential to cause esophageal irritation. The same recommendation applies to the related drug Actonel, but a full hour is recommended for the related drug Boniva.
Similarly, the thyroid drug levothyroxine should be taken “on an empty stomach, one-half to one hour before breakfast.” But one should not assume that an empty stomach always implies that a medication should be taken first thing in the morning. Some medications should be taken on an empty stomach at bedtime. This is the case with the H.I.V. drug Sustiva. Taking Sustiva on an empty stomach regulates its absorption. And, taking it at bedtime makes the dizziness and drowsiness that it causes more tolerable.",2018-09-28 09:00:04,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,gastric
130,"What Is Bariatric Surgery, and How Does It Work?","Bariatric surgery is an option that obesity medicine specialists say is too often ignored or dismissed. Yet it is the only option that almost always works to help very heavy people lose a lot of weight and that also can mysteriously make some chronic conditions vanish. Here are some answers about bariatric surgery and what it does.
HOW MANY AMERICANS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR BARIATRIC SURGERY?
Twenty-four million, according to the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery. The criteria are a body mass index above 40, or a B.M.I. of at least 35 along with other medical conditions like diabetes, hypertension, sleep apnea or acid reflux.
HOW MANY HAVE THE SURGERY EACH YEAR?
Fewer than 200,000.
WHAT ARE THE OPERATIONS?
There are four in use today. The two most popular procedures are the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and the gastric sleeve. Both make the stomach smaller. The bypass also reroutes the small intestine. A simpler procedure, the gastric band, is less effective and has fallen out of favor. And a much more drastic operation, the biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch, which bypasses a large part of the small intestine, is rarely used because it has higher mortality and complication rates.
HOW MUCH DO THE OPERATIONS COST?
The average cost of a sleeve gastrectomy is $16,000 to $19,000, and the average cost of a gastric bypass is $20,000 to $25,000. Most insurance plans cover the cost for patients who qualify, though some plans require that patients try dieting for a certain amount of time first.",2016-12-27 08:30:25,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,gastric
131,"WHAT'S NEXT; The Virtual Stomach (No, It's Not a Diet Aid)","Because many details of events that occur within the stomach are still unknown, other researchers studying the gastrointestinal tract say that the new model may prove useful.
''Professor Brasseur's work helps in doing the precise analysis of what the movements of the stomach walls are doing to the contents of the stomach,'' said Konrad Schultz, a professor in the department of internal medicine at the University of Iowa.
The current basis for information on compounds that disperse slowly in the stomach is entirely empirical, he said. ''Understanding the forces of disintegration that occur in the stomach would allow the design of shapes and preparations of drugs that could be better in terms of slow, sustained release of medication.''
Anupam Pal, a postdoctoral student of Dr. Brasseur's, developed the computer code for the virtual stomach and is the lead author of a recent report describing the model. ''The work involves the same knowledge as that used in designing turbines,'' he said, ''only here it's applied to the human body.''
The virtual stomach has led to a number of practical findings, Dr. Brasseur said. ''One of the first things we learned was that the tablet has to get toward the bottom of the stomach to start breaking down,'' he said. The breakdown largely occurs in the area at the bottom of the stomach near the pyloric valve that controls the rate at which the contents leave the stomach.
The group has also found that density of the tablets is important. ''If the tablet is slightly buoyant, it floats up and takes a while to get pushed into the contraction area,'' Dr. Brasseur said.
Dr. Brasseur, who has previously done mechanics-based research on the esophagus and pharynx, as well as other spots along the gastrointestinal track, plans on proceeding to the small intestine when his work on the stomach is complete.",2002-10-31 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,gastric
132,A Daunting Operation Offers Relief to Obese Teenagers,"He estimated that about 8 percent of American teenagers would qualify.
“These are not kids who are pleasantly plump,” said Dr. John Morton , a bariatric surgeon at Yale University. “Once you have a B.M.I. of 30, it is really difficult to lose weight on your own.”
There is no other treatment that results in a substantial and sustained weight loss in people who are severely obese. But the operation, gastric bypass surgery, is demanding. Surgeons close off most of the stomach, leaving a small pouch, and reroute the intestines. Afterward, patients must eat tiny meals at frequent intervals for the rest of their lives.
It is a scenario that gives many parents pause. Should their teenagers wait, hoping science will come up with a less drastic solution? Or should their children have the operation before even more serious harm to the body occurs?
Adding to the quandary is the fact there are just six accredited bariatric surgery centers in pediatric hospitals. Although some adult programs operate on teenagers, most of such procedures are done in pediatric settings, Dr. Morton said.
Adults, by contrast, may choose from 850 accredited medical centers for weight-loss surgery.
Although the new study included adolescents with B.M.I.s of 35, most were much heavier. The average was 50, the same as the average for adults in the study.
For most of the adolescents, the surgery was a success. On average, they lost about a quarter of their body weight, enough to make life much easier and for most to shed health problems.
The teenagers weighed 324 pounds on average when they had the surgery. Five years later, the figure was 244 pounds. The adults weighed the same at the start and had a nearly identical result .",2019-05-16 18:14:53,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,gastric

A. The point of consuming a probiotic supplement in a food like yogurt, a powder or a capsule is to introduce beneficial bacteria in the gut, said Dr. Christine Frissora, a gastroenterologist at the Center for Advanced Digestive Care at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell hospital.
There are questions about whether these bacteria survive the gastric acid, make it down to the small intestine or colon and live to have any biological effects. “Certain bacteria have the capability to survive gastric acid and others do not,” Dr. Frissora said.
Some bacteria have a polysaccharide (or complex carbohydrate) capsule that protects the inner organism like armor, she said. Others have a complex electrolyte pump that pumps acid out of the cell, providing protection from destruction.",2014-03-31 20:13:42,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,gastric

Dr. Najarian said the spleen was seven or eight times normal for a child of Jamie's age, but he also said her liver ''is perfectly normal.''

The physicians, from Children's Hospital in Washington, reported encouraging results in two of three operations performed since June, 1972.

The surgery is believed to be the first of its kind performed on an infant, but may become routine.
``We made special arrangements in this case because of this family's religious beliefs, but from now on, we'll do this on every child to reduce our use of blood products,'' said Dr. Yuri Genyk, a member of the surgery team.

141,"LIFE, DEATH AND THE RIGHTS OF HANDICAPPED BABIES","Dr. Mildred T. Stahlman, director of the division of neonatology of Vanderbilt University, in Nashville, said the primary problem in her experience was that of babies of extremely low birth weight born through difficult deliveries after difficult pregnancies who were kept alive for weeks and even years by modern technology. Sometimes they do very well in the long run, she said, but some go through an agonizing roller coaster of ups and downs and then sink gradually to death, despite everything doctors can do.
She drew a grim picture of such a baby unable to breathe without a respirator, unable to take nourishment except by vein, blind, unconscious, subject to seizures, heart failure, kidney failure, suffering from rickets with bones so fragile that they break even with the most careful handling. Yet it is sometimes possible to keep such a baby alive for many months.
How long, she asked, must doctors postpone the inevitable death? She said public health services and education to improve the health of pregnant woman and fetus are urgently needed. She and other witnesses said excessive zeal on the part of the Department of Health and Human Services in pursuing the discrimination issue could tragically prolong the suffering of dying babies.
Dr. Joseph F. Boyle, president of the American Medical Association, testified that only a very small number of births involve any serious risk to survival and that among that small fraction can be only a minuscule number of cases in which doctors and parents are less than totally dedicated to the baby's welfare.

He said Federal officials investigated more than 40 allegations of improper treatment and found not a single case of neglect or child abuse.

He was 88.
In a case of life imitating art, Mr. Ayres was a conscientious objector during World War II and for that reason became a Hollywood outcast. Before the war, he had been one of the most popular leading men in the movies. But when he announced his pacifism, which had a religious basis, he was shunned by the studios, and in some cities exhibitors refused to show his movies. He said that to bear arms would cause him ''to live in a nightmare of hypocrisy.''
After two months in a labor camp, he entered the Army as a noncombatant, serving for three and a half years in the Medical Corps and winning three battle stars. After the war, he resumed his career and made scores of movies, but never reached the peak of his early Hollywood stardom.
On screen and off, he projected a sincerity and strength of character, all of which suited him well, especially when he played doctors. He was also cast as a lawyer or journalist and occasionally played a gangster, but his archetypal role was as a wise and compassionate physician.

144,Treating the Incredible Shrinking Vagina,"So, vaginal atrophy. What’s that about? I (very tentatively) asked my general practitioner about how the whole “vagina after menopause” thing works and she was basically “yeah, that’s right, it will atrophy.” So what can be done about it, if anything? Frankly, I’m a bit sad.
— Shrinking Violet
[Have a question about women’s health? Ask Dr. Gunter yourself.]
Short Take
There are changes that happen to the vagina and vulva with menopause. We used to call this vaginal atrophy, as the tissue becomes thinner and can even shrink. However, that terminology — while technically medically accurate for some menopause-related changes — sounds dismissive and neglects the fact that these changes affect more than the vagina. We now refer to these changes as genitourinary syndrome of menopause or G.S.M. The vulvar and vaginal symptoms of G.S.M. are distressing for many women. Fortunately, they can almost always be treated.
Tell Me More
G.S.M. is primarily caused by dropping levels of estrogen during menopause. As a result, the skin of the vulva and the vagina become thinner with a loss of elasticity. The labia minora can also reduce in size.
Common symptoms of G.S.M. include vaginal or vulvar dryness. Other symptoms can occur during sex, including loss of lubrication, an uncomfortable sandpaper-like sensation, pain, difficulties achieving orgasm and even tearing of the vagina or vulva. There is also an increased risk of urinary tract infections.",2019-09-19 14:00:03,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,atresia

His recuperation was com pleted June 10, when he re turned to the Expos’ active roster. But he batted only two times before being traded for the seventh time—to the Reds for Clyde Mashore, an outfielder, on June 15, the trading deadline and his 31st birthday.
“We had tried to get him in the winter,” explained Sparky Anderson, the Reds’ manager. “He's such a good extra man. He's ideal. He can play all three outfield posi tions and he can pinch‐hit.
“He's the kind of guy who's more valuable to a winning team than a losing team. We weren't concerned with his physical status because they assured us he was okay.”
Cline, a left‐handed hitter, appeared in 63 games with Cincinnati during the season, rapping 17 hits (eight for extra bases) for a 270 av erage.
About his key hit today, he said:
“The ball just scooted out there. That's the way this park is. When you hit the ball low, it stays low. When I neared second, I figured I had a chance to get to third. When I saw Alex [Grammas, the third‐base coach] give me the sign to slide and saw [Richie] Hebner get ready to catch the ball, all I could think of was ‘Let me get to the bag or let the ball hit me.’ “
A drive that didn't get to right‐center, it turned out, cost the Pirates a victory in nine innings. It was a hard shot that Dave Cash hit with two out and runners at sec ond and third in the third inn ing.

147,The New York Times,"Israel was shocked by how much weight the young man had lost since he’d last seen him. As he hugged him he could feel the bony knobs of his spine beneath his thin shirt. The young man began to describe the strange pain that had come from nowhere and dominated his life for the past three months. It was a tearing, burning pain, always in the upper-left side of his abdomen. And it would come on suddenly  often just after he ate. These excruciating attacks would last a few hours, then, just as unexpectedly, disappear, as if nothing had happened. Recently the attacks were coming more frequently, lasting longer, and were often accompanied by nausea and vomiting. He tried not to eat, since that seemed to be one trigger, but even that wasn’t working anymore.
Image A barium X-ray would have revealed any obstructions in the small intestine. Credit... Innerspace Imaging/Photo Researchers
2. Investigation
The young man paused, then added that just a few days before his first episode of pain, he had gotten injured playing hockey  a violent collision on the ice where his stick was jammed hard into his rib cage. The patient said he felt that the two were related even though the stick hit him on the right side and this strange, intermittent pain was on the left. He had no other pertinent medical history. He took no medicines, didn’t smoke, drank occasionally, was very physically active. He had already been to several specialists and had lots of tests: blood work, a CT scan, several M.R.I.’s. Nothing panned out.
On exam, the patient’s abdomen was soft, with normal sounds. Israel could feel no masses, but the pulsation of the aorta was surprisingly prominent. Was it pronounced because the boy was so thin? Or was there something wrong with the muscular pipe that carried the blood from the heart to the rest of the body? Could this be Marfan syndrome, a congenital abnormality of the connective tissues of the body? The boy had the body type of those who carry this genetic mutation  tall and thin with long arms and legs. In this disease, the defective tissues can’t hold up against the onslaught of pressure in the aorta and patients frequently develop areas of weakness that are prone to rupture. It seemed very unlikely, but it would be tragic to miss.
What else then? These words are the most essential component of a difficult diagnosis. What else could this be? The pain started after the hockey accident  but Israel could see no way to link the injury on the right with this recurring pain on the left. Obstruction in the small intestine could cause pain and vomiting after eating. But why would he have an obstruction? In adults, an obstruction is usually the result of the scar tissue that forms after an operation, which prevents the small intestine from moving normally, but this young man had had no operations. Kidney stones could cause this kind of intense, intermittent pain. But that should have been picked up on the CT scan he already had.
Israel told the young man that he wasn’t sure what was causing his pain. He suggested a second CT scan of his abdomen. He’d need to look over the other tests before he could figure out what else might be needed. It pained the internist to see the hope fade away from the boy’s face as yet another doctor disappointed him.",2008-05-11 04:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,meckel diverticulum

Does grilling medical students with questions make them into better doctors? For years, many professors routinely peppered students with relevant and arcane queries, often embarrassing them. Things may be gentler today, but the practice, referred to as the ""pimping"" of students, still has its advocates.
""Such questioning has always been used in medical education,"" said Dr. Kenneth M. Ludmerer, a physician and historian of medicine at the Washington University School of Medicine and the author of ""Time to Heal.""
A favorite time to grill students has been on rounds, when doctors and students examine hospitalized patients. Here, senior attending physicians may ask students to list the various types of lymphomas, point out structures on X-rays, describe clotting disorders or choose among antibiotics.
At times, particular students are singled out, especially if they are following the patient in question. If the student is having difficulty and the senior doctor keeps pushing, rounds may suddenly become very uncomfortable. At other times, other students or resident physicians may be allowed to bail out their colleagues.",2006-03-14 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,meckel diverticulum

150,The Guest Word,"In olden times when everybody in the middle class had an attic, some of the liveliest reading material in the house was stashed away up under the eaves. There, behind mounds of broken furniture and decaying lampshades, buried under a faltering pyramid of aged textbooks and inspirational religious works lay the long‐forgotten family “doctor” book, property of an earlier generation and mother lode to prurient adolescents. This volume, four inches thick, with embossed cloth binding often lettered in gold to rival The Holy Bible, went by various titles—“The Home Medical Advisor,” “The Complete Home Medical Counselor,” etc. (“Home” lent reassurance in the presence of delicate subject matter.)
It was a relic of the days when, presumably, the doctor couldn't get there soon enough and the panicked household had to cope unaided with inflamed felons, burns from exploding camphor lamps and Pink Eye. The descriptions of symptoms and remedies were spellbinding: “sharp, shooting pains in the back, brickdust in the urine”—“put hot water to feet, bind poultices of mustard and flour on the wrists and ankles.” Especially spellbinding were the ominous sections devoted to ailments of the bowels and genitourinary system and other exotica (“Diseases of the Breast—Female”), profusely illustrated with cloudy wood engravings.
Now Simon & Schuster has revived this fine old tradition with its handsome, authoritative sourcebook for the enquiring layman, “The Complete Surgical Guide: The New Understanding Surgery,” by Robert Rothenberg, M.D., F.A.C.S. It is described as, “the most definitive one‐volume encyclopedia available on surgical practices and techniques for the prospective patient or concerned family.” (Other works in the near dozen edited or written by Dr. Rothenberg include the four‐volume “New Illustrated Medical Encyclopedia” and the 20‐volume “New Complete Medical Encyclopedia.”) Like its forebears, the “Surgical Guide” offers a thorough catalogue (funnel chest, furuncles, gall bladder, ganglions; in the section “Kidneys and Ureters” no stone is left unturned). Here are the old familiar favorites—wens, boils, felons, bunions, Quinsy—and inviting new ones, too: Bell's palsy, Baker's cyst, Osgood Schlatter's disease, Morton's toe, Meckel's diverticulum, Dupuytren's contracture, Wilm's tumor.
The illustrations, however, aren't muddy woodcuts but crisp line drawings (“Intestinal bypass operation for obesity”; “Steps in plastic operation for enlarged, hanging breast”). And since nowadays the doctor never comes, guidance is also afforded in the classic domestic crises—black eye, cuts, electric shock, snake bite, spider bite, frostbite, etc. To all of this the “Guide” adds a new dimension. It tells you what the doctor is going to be up to after the anesthetist puts you under. In Vagotomy and Pyloroplasty (“a combined operation”), for example, “the vagus nerve is cut and the muscles and mucous membranes at the outlet of the stomach are severed and resutured in such a way as to allow the alkaline secretions of the duodenum to flow back into stomach.”",1974-06-23 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,meckel diverticulum
151,River Blindness Disease Has 2d Devastating Side,"River blindness is a disease caused by the parasitic worm Onchocerca volvulus, spread by the bites of tiny black flies that breed in fast-moving river water. Microscopic larvae produced by adult worms migrate to the skin of the human host and often cause blindness when they reach the eyes.
An estimated 17.6 million people in Africa are infected with the parasites, experts say, with about half being inflicted with the ""savanna"" strain of the disease, which causes blindness and skin complications. However, they say, some 8.6 million are infected with the ""forest"" strain that rarely produces blindness, but results in severe skin disease.
Previous disease control efforts have focused on areas where blindness is most prevalent, and river blindness has been brought under control in the savanna belt of West Africa in the last decade through blackfly spraying programs and use of the drug ivermectin. The drug, developed by Merck & Company of Rahway, N.J., and used since 1987, prevents blindness with one annual dose by killing newly hatched worms. The treatment costs about 70 cents per person per year.
The new skin disease study, conducted by eight health centers in West, Central and East Africa, found that the forest strain of the disease caused severe itching that interfered with sleep and work, as well as skin lesions and discoloration, fatigue, joint-bone pain and headaches. Surveys found that the skin lesions ranged from rashes to severe, spotty discolorations. Many victims also suffered a change in skin texture that caused it to stretch and hang, and take on the appearance of lizard skin.
Patients reported that their skin conditions caused others to avoid them for fear of infection, and made it difficult for them to marry or get work.",1995-03-28 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,volvulus

As wondrous as the effects have been, the drug is not a total cure since it does not kill the adult parasites, which can remain in the body and continue to produce the microworms.
Now in early experiments, a new drug appears to be effective in destroying the adults. Taken together the drugs might deliver a one-two punch to knock out the disease.
Scientists from Ciba-Geigy in Basel, Switzerland, have tested the drug, amocarzine, in patients in Guatemala and Ecuador. Their results were reported in a recent issue of The Lancet, a British medical journal.
In a trial involving 312 patients, the scientists administered three milligrams of amocarzine twice a day for three days. Four months later, 73 percent of the female parasites had been killed. The microworms were also substantially reduced, and counts remained low for up to two years. The drug's side effects included mild dizziness, itching and rash.
""This drug is still in the investigative stage,"" said Dr. Anton A. Poltera of Ciba-Geigy, who led the study. He said larger community trials in Africa and Latin America had to be completed to determine the appropriate treatment regime for different populations, minimizing side effects.

154,RIVER BLINDNESS: CONQUERING AN ANCIENT SCOURGE,"AS WE BEGIN OUR MEETING, THE CHIEF OF SIKORONI APOLO-gizes because a few of the family heads, those who can see well enough to work, are out in their fields and cannot come. Actually, he says, it is 13 of the village's 20 family leaders who have lost their vision. Many other men and women in the village have been blinded, too. They sit quietly in their huts, or perhaps under a tree in distant fields, helping out by picking peanuts off plants that others have harvested this morning.
''Here,'' the chief says, ''before you have white hair it is normal to become blind.'' The chief himself can still see, barely. But the scaly, mottled skin on his legs reveals that he, too, is burdened with the parasitic worms.
Nowhere does river blindness take a greater toll than in the West African savanna, a huge belt of grass and trees that spans more than a dozen countries and divides the fringes of the Sahara from the coastal rain forests. In hundreds of villages with the bad luck to be situated near prime black-fly breeding sites, nearly all the residents are infected and, as in Sikoroni, perhaps a tenth of them are blind, including a majority of those over 45 or 50. Thousands more villages are afflicted to a lesser degree.
The victims were never hard to spot during my dusty two-week journey in the countries of Mali and Guinea, through valleys infested with the disease. Along any of the region's red-dirt roads you are apt to see a man being led by a boy with a stick. And inside nearly every family compound in the afflicted villages, in scenes that never ceased to startle me, sightless men and women sit, idly and patiently.
I found it hard to imagine the meaning of blindness in these isolated settlements, where hard labor is needed to squeeze a bare sustenance from the land. Some contributed by weaving baskets or picking peanuts off roots. But this is far from the energetic work normally demanded of adults.
Yiriba Bissan, a Malian entomologist working with the Onchocerciasis Control Program, described some consequences of the disease. His knowledge is not academic. As a child in a remote village in the south of Mali, he said, ''my job every morning was to lead my blind uncle to a big tree, far from the village.'' There the two spent their days in the shade. ''For three years, I did this,'' Dr. Bissan, now 36, recalled. Five years ago, his father became blind, and now his mother is nearly so.
For those who go blind, Dr. Bissan said, a large stable family is crucial. Blind people can often be absorbed into the extended family. Indeed, some can even prosper; in one village I visited, the chief, resplendent in white robes, had kept his power and prestige through 18 years of blindness. But for blind people without the support of a strong family, ''it is horrible,'' Dr. Bissan observed. They are especially vulnerable to superstition, to stories that their affliction is divine punishment for misdeeds. ''When you are alone in this society, when you have no wife or no husband, and no children to support you, people say you are 'finished,' '' he continued. ''Here, to be 'finished' is worse than to die.'' Researchers have found that when the rate of blindness in a village exceeds 10 percent or so, fearful young people leave, farm production is curtailed and social fissures widen. Whole swaths of fertile valley land have been abandoned to the black flies, this in a region short of good farmland and beset by droughts and famines.",1989-01-08 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,volvulus
155,Article 488386 -- No Title,"To the Editor:
My law firm represents Agnes Mae Whitaker, a victim of medical malpractice, and I am shocked and dismayed that you dismiss her fight for justice and vindication by a jury as nothing more than ''luck'' (''The $65 Million Malpractice Question,'' editorial, July 24).
Before she was victimized by medical malpractice, Ms. Whitaker was a healthy, vibrant and self-supporting member of the community. Then, in July 1982, she had the misfortune of being a patient at New York City's Lincoln Hospital.
Her condition (a volvulus, or constriction of the small intenstine) was misdiagnosed; she was incorrectly sent for a gynecological examination, where a negligent physician managed to puncture her bowel and lacerate her ovary; she was allowed to languish in the hallway outside the emergency room for hours, while her small intestine - which should have been treated - was permitted to become infected and gangrenous. Then Lincoln Hospital discharged her.
As a result of this medical malpractice at Lincoln Hospital, Ms. Whitaker had to be rushed from her home to another hospital, where doctors managed to save her life. Unfortunately, by this time it was necessary to remove virtually her entire small intestine. Her ordeal at Lincoln Hospital also caused her to suffer kidney failure, impairment of hearing and collapse of her spinal vertebrae, which has already partly crippled Ms. Whitaker and will shortly result in her being totally confined to a wheelchair. Additionally, she will have to be returned to a special nutritional program in which she will be fed through a catheter in her chest.",1986-08-07 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,volvulus
156,NEW DRUG MAY CURB TROPIC 'RIVER BLINDNESS',"A single dose of a new drug appears to be effective in treating ''river blindness,'' a parasitic disease that is a major cause of blindness, scientists from the United States, Senegal and France have reported on the basis of a small study in West Africa. The new drug is called ivermectin.
River blindness, also called onchocerciasis, is a chronic infection caused by a filarial roundworm called Onchocerca volvulus. The human body reacts to an invasion of the worms by producing scar tissue in the skin and eyes. Migration of the worms through the skin produces an intensely itchy rash. Although onchocerciasis can blind a person, it usually is not fatal.
The disease is spread by the bite of infected female black flies of the genus Simulium that breed along fast-moving streams. The infection is common in sub-Sahara Africa in an area extending from Senegal to Ethiopia, and from Angola in the west to Malawi in the east, according to the American Public Health Association.
River blindness also occurs in Yemen, the states of Chiapas and Oaxaca in southern Mexico, the western slope of the continental divide in Guatemala, Venezuela, small areas in Colombia and the state of Amazonas in Brazil.

157,The New York Times,"And if the stool contains a lot of water and moves quickly through the digestive tract, the theory holds, intestinal tissues are less likely to be exposed to concentrated doses of toxins and cancer‐causing substances produced in the gut, possibly lowering the risk of colon‐rectal cancer. There are also claims that fiber enhances the excretion of cholesterol, thereby protecting against heart disease.
The scientific evidence supporting and countering the purported benefits of fiber include the following:
Many researchers point out that Dr. Burkitt's assessment of various countries failed to take into account not only differences in life styles but also vast differences in other dietary components, such as the large amounts of animal fats and meats eaten by Americans. These scientists say that a high fat diet is much more closely related to the risk of developing colon cancer and heart disease than is lack of dietary fiber. further, they report, constipated people are no more likely to get cancer than with those regular stools.
Studies in patients and medical logic do support the suggestion that highfiber diets can alleviate and possibly prevent diverticular disease, which afflicts two in five Americans over the age of 40. For decades, symptomatic patients have been treated with bland diets low in roughage. Now it appears that just the opposite is best. According to Dr. Alastair M. Connell, an expert on digestive diseases at the University of Cincinnati, a diet high in roughage is far more effective in relieving symptoms and reducing the need for surgery. He excepts patients with colonic constrictions or severe inflammation.
Ten separate studies have shown that eating fiber in the form of bran does not lower blood levels of cholesterol or triglycerides. But pectins, found in relatively large amounts in fruits (especially apples, pears, peaches, oranges and grapes), guar gum (a thickener extracted from the cluster bean), rolled oats and bengal gram (chickpeas) can reduce cholesterol in people and/or animals.
No studies have yet shown that a high‐fiber diet will promote weight loss in people. However, it is far more difficult to consume the same number of calories contained in refined carbohydrates as unrefined fibrous carbohydrates. It would take about three pounds of apples, for example, to equal the carbohydrate content of one candy bar. In one study, volunteers who ate most of their carbohydrates as refined sugars often felt hungry, whereas those fed the like amount of carbohydrates as vegetable and cereal starches complained of being “stuffed.” Fibrous foods also take a longer time to chew and thus give the body time to register a sense of satiety before more calories are consumed than the body really needs.
In one recent study, a high‐fiber diet fed to persons with diabetes produced a lowering of sugar and fats in the blood, and several patients were able to discontinue their antidiabetic drug treatment by tripling their ordinary intake of unrefined carbohydrates.
•
High‐fiber diets can also have some undesirable effects. The most common is a temporary increase in flatulence and bloating, usually lasting about three weeks but in some cases for two or more months. Fibrous foods may impair the absorption of other nutrients, including iron and zinc, but this is thought to be no problem among otherwise well‐nourished people.",1977-03-30 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,volvulus
158,U.S. in a Push To Bar Vaccine Given to Infants,"Federal health officials yesterday called for the immediate suspension of a vaccine recently recommended for all infants to protect against rotavirus, the most common cause of severe diarrhea in infants and young children.
The Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said it took the extraordinary action because a program that monitors vaccine side-effects suggested a link between the drug, licensed last year, and 20 cases of a painful blockage of the bowel called intussusception. The disease, which can in rare cases be fatal, affects an estimated 3.5 million in the United States a year.
Although there is no conclusive evidence that the vaccine causes the bowel condition, officials at the disease-control centers said the data are so strongly suggestive of a link that they considered it prudent to advise halting rotavirus vaccinations at least until November, by which time a new study of the vaccine will be completed.
''No one should now be giving rotavirus vaccine to anyone,'' said Barbara Reynolds, a centers spokeswoman.",1999-07-16 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,intussusception

160,The New York Times,"Israel was shocked by how much weight the young man had lost since he’d last seen him. As he hugged him he could feel the bony knobs of his spine beneath his thin shirt. The young man began to describe the strange pain that had come from nowhere and dominated his life for the past three months. It was a tearing, burning pain, always in the upper-left side of his abdomen. And it would come on suddenly  often just after he ate. These excruciating attacks would last a few hours, then, just as unexpectedly, disappear, as if nothing had happened. Recently the attacks were coming more frequently, lasting longer, and were often accompanied by nausea and vomiting. He tried not to eat, since that seemed to be one trigger, but even that wasn’t working anymore.

2. Investigation
The young man paused, then added that just a few days before his first episode of pain, he had gotten injured playing hockey  a violent collision on the ice where his stick was jammed hard into his rib cage. The patient said he felt that the two were related even though the stick hit him on the right side and this strange, intermittent pain was on the left. He had no other pertinent medical history. He took no medicines, didn’t smoke, drank occasionally, was very physically active. He had already been to several specialists and had lots of tests: blood work, a CT scan, several M.R.I.’s. Nothing panned out.
On exam, the patient’s abdomen was soft, with normal sounds. Israel could feel no masses, but the pulsation of the aorta was surprisingly prominent. Was it pronounced because the boy was so thin? Or was there something wrong with the muscular pipe that carried the blood from the heart to the rest of the body? Could this be Marfan syndrome, a congenital abnormality of the connective tissues of the body? The boy had the body type of those who carry this genetic mutation  tall and thin with long arms and legs. In this disease, the defective tissues can’t hold up against the onslaught of pressure in the aorta and patients frequently develop areas of weakness that are prone to rupture. It seemed very unlikely, but it would be tragic to miss.
What else then? These words are the most essential component of a difficult diagnosis. What else could this be? The pain started after the hockey accident  but Israel could see no way to link the injury on the right with this recurring pain on the left. Obstruction in the small intestine could cause pain and vomiting after eating. But why would he have an obstruction? In adults, an obstruction is usually the result of the scar tissue that forms after an operation, which prevents the small intestine from moving normally, but this young man had had no operations. Kidney stones could cause this kind of intense, intermittent pain. But that should have been picked up on the CT scan he already had.
Israel told the young man that he wasn’t sure what was causing his pain. He suggested a second CT scan of his abdomen. He’d need to look over the other tests before he could figure out what else might be needed. It pained the internist to see the hope fade away from the boy’s face as yet another doctor disappointed him.",2008-05-11 04:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,intussusception
161,"In Turnabout, Federal Panel Votes Against A Vaccine","In a rare and embarrassing reversal, a Federal health advisory panel yesterday withdrew its recommendation that all infants be immunized against the virus that causes a severe form of diarrhea after the vaccine was linked to a painful and potentially fatal bowel obstruction.
The action comes a year after the Government licensed the rotavirus vaccine, and three months after it abruptly suspended its use because of reports that some babies who took it were coming down with the bowel condition. A week ago the manufacturer, American Home Products of Madison, N.J., withdrew the vaccine from the market.
And yesterday, the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said new scientific studies showed that the vaccine, Rotashield, appeared to cause the bowel obstruction in about 1 in 5,000 recipients.
Despite the suspension in July, the advisory panel's formal position until yesterday had been that all infants in the United States should receive three doses of the vaccine, at 2, 4 and 6 months of age.

163,Vaccine for Infant Diarrhea Is Withdrawn as Health Risk,"American Home Products, the manufacturer of the only licensed vaccine to prevent the most common cause of severe diarrhea among infants and children, announced today that it was withdrawing the vaccine from the market because of concerns that it could cause a painful and potentially fatal bowel obstruction.
The diarrhea is caused by the rotavirus, and last year the Government recommended that every infant in the United States get the protective vaccine. One million children swallowed three doses of the vaccine, Rotashield, at 2, 4 and 6 months of age, the company said.
But in July the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, a Federal agency based here, said no one should get the vaccine because a program that monitors side effects suggested a link between the vaccine and the bowel condition, called intussusception.
Today, prompted by more than 100 reports of intussusception to the agency -- more than half of them within a week of vaccination -- American Home Products asked doctors and health workers to return all unused vaccine immediately. It said it would wait for completed studies to determine whether withdrawal of the vaccine would be permanent.",1999-10-16 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,intussusception

Studies of the two vaccines, one made by Merck and one by GlaxoSmithKline, are to be published today in The New England Journal of Medicine. Each trial enrolled more than 60,000 infants, in part to avoid the fate that befell the last licensed rotavirus vaccine, which was withdrawn seven years ago after it was blamed for dangerous bowel obstructions in 1 in 10,000 children.

Public health officials have grown more vigilant since then. In 1999, for instance, doctors reported cases of intussusception, a sometimes deadly intestinal disorder, in a few infants given a new vaccine against rotavirus. After a causal link was confirmed, the vaccine was withdrawn.
Six years later, there were more reports of Guillain-Barré, in patients who had received a new vaccine against meningococcal bacteria. This time, vaccine safety sleuths found that the association was rare or even coincidental, and the Food and Drug Administration kept the vaccine on the market.
The need for good safety monitoring is more important than ever in this risk-averse age, in which a discredited link to autism has shaken confidence in childhood vaccination. It’s equally important that officials communicate the difference between correlation and cause.
It is statistically inevitable that some of the millions of people vaccinated this fall will become ill or die. And there’s a high risk that the vaccine will be blamed for any coincidental health problems. For example, pregnant women will be urged to get the vaccine because doctors have seen how H1N1 can cause especially nasty infections during pregnancy. But about one in seven pregnancies ends in a miscarriage, so nearly 1,500 of 10,000 women in early pregnancy will miscarry this fall  whether or not they get the H1N1 vaccine.",2009-08-01 23:51:11,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,intussusception

168,Just How Distressing Is Lactose Intolerance?,"""I know that a lot of people are going to have trouble believing the results of this study because they have come to believe that even a little lactose will bring on their symptoms,"" said Dr. Michael D. Levitt of the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Minneapolis, the senior investigator. ""But the results speak for themselves. A sizable fraction who are lactase deficient don't have problems with consuming the equivalent of a cup of milk a day.""
Dr. Levitt said he believed that many people say milk is to blame for their digestive problems because lactose intolerance has been so well publicized and widely discussed. In addition, he said, in the last few years, more products to counteract the problem have been advertised, including pills to take with meals, specially processed milk and other dairy products and milk additives.
Dr. Frank A. Hamilton, an expert in digestive diseases at the National Institutes of Health, praised the study as well designed and said it ""lays to rest some of the controversy about lactose intolerance."" But he cautioned that because the study involved only 30 people, it should not be used to conclude that no one needed to use lactose-reduced milk or other digestive aids when consuming dairy products.
""Deficiency in lactase varies, and some patients are known to be sensitive to four ounces of milk or less,"" said Dr. Hamilton, chief of the digestive diseases branch at the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. ""But many patients attribute all digestive symptoms to lactose intolerance, and this study shows us that we should also look at other reasons.""
Dr. Gregory D. Miller, vice president for nutrition at the National Dairy Council, the research and education association for the industry, said that while lactose intolerance was a problem for some, it had become ""a bit of a health fad."" Twenty-five to 28 percent of American adults do not digest lactose because of insufficient lactase enzyme, he said, ""but having lactase maldigestion doesn't necessarily mean avoiding dairy foods, as we have been saying for some time and as this new study suggests,"" he added.",1995-07-12 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,lactose intolerance

This year, on defense and the offensive line, there was so much new personnel and because of various injuries, not much time to practice together. Result: disaster. I can not imagine them having another start like this next year, particularly because they will keep most of the roster intact. At the beginning of the season, Herm said it could take half a year for the defense to gel. I'm sure he didn't think it would be as bad as it was, but he was essentially correct in his timetable.""

If the Jets have to play both of those teams, it's a tough road. Then again, the entire league is insane this season, so there is no predicting what will happen.""
... the ascendance of Chad Pennington : ""Chad has been remarkably poised. It's probably a result of two things: he had two-plus years to prepare for this and he studied extremely hard. Plus, he's the son of a coach, so nothing in football is foreign to him. He has seen everything a million times since he was 3 years old. As for his poise holding up in the Super Bowl. Tom Brady's did and I think Chad is much further along in football development and in temperament. He does not seem to be rattled by anything that is happening to him.""

The finding, published today in the journal Nature Genetics, may lead to the development of a more accurate test for the condition.
Lactose intolerance can cause bloating and indigestion from consuming milk or milk products. More than 30 million Americans, mostly black or Asian, are prone to the condition.
Though lactose intolerance may sound like a disorder, it is in fact natural. In most people the gene for lactase, the enzyme that digests lactose, is switched on at birth and switched off at the age of weaning.
In most Europeans, however, the lactase gene remains active. With the domestication of cattle and goats in the Near East some 10,000 years ago, the ability to digest lactose throughout life could have conferred some nutritional advantage. Biologists speculate that a mutation that prolonged the gene's activity was suddenly favored and spread throughout the population.",2002-01-14 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,lactose intolerance

172,Lactose Tolerance in East Africa Points to Recent Evolution,"A surprisingly recent instance of human evolution has been detected among the peoples of East Africa. It is the ability to digest milk in adulthood, conferred by genetic changes that occurred as recently as 3,000 years ago, a team of geneticists has found.
The finding is a striking example of a cultural practice — the raising of dairy cattle — feeding back into the human genome. It also seems to be one of the first instances of convergent human evolution to be documented at the genetic level. Convergent evolution refers to two or more populations acquiring the same trait independently.
Throughout most of human history, the ability to digest lactose, the principal sugar of milk, has been switched off after weaning because the lactase enzyme that breaks the sugar apart is no longer needed. But when cattle were first domesticated 9,000 years ago and people later started to consume their milk as well as their meat, natural selection would have favored anyone with a mutation that kept the lactase gene switched on.
Such a mutation is known to have arisen among an early cattle-raising people, the Funnel Beaker culture, which flourished 5,000 to 6,000 years ago in north-central Europe. People with a persistently active lactase gene have no problem digesting milk and are said to be lactose tolerant.",2006-12-11 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,lactose intolerance

After a day of avoiding all foods that contain lactose, first thing in the morning on an empty stomach, consume a quart of nonfat milk within two hours. If symptoms develop before you drink the entire quart, stop. This test, however, has limitations, since it lacks an objective measurement of an inability to digest lactose. Rather than being caused by lactose, the symptoms may be psychologically induced. More accurate tests, done over the course of several hours in a medical setting, involve measuring the amount of hydrogen in the breath or glucose in the blood after the person consumes a solution of lactose in water.
In a test by Dr. Michael D. Levitt and colleagues at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Minneapolis, of 30 people who described themselves as severely lactose intolerant, 9 were found to have no problem with lactose digestion.
In another study published this month in The American Journal for Clinical Nutrition, Dr. Levitt's group could document lactase deficiency in only 34 of 49 men and women who said they experienced symptoms after consuming one cup of milk. Nineteen of those 34 were tested further. Twice a day they were given one cup of either lactose-reduced milk or regular milk to drink, but they reported no greater incidence of symptoms after consuming the regular milk.
The researchers concluded that most people with lactase deficiency tolerated two cups of milk per day ''without appreciable symptoms'' and that some people who thought they were severely lactose intolerant developed intestinal gas for other reasons.
Living With the Condition
Lactose intolerance is dose-dependent. While you may be able to consume half a glass of milk on an empty stomach without developing symptoms, two glasses could make you very uncomfortable. Milk consumed at the end of a meal or along with other foods, especially fiber-rich foods like a whole-grain cereal, is likely to be more readily digested.
The type of dairy product makes a difference, as well. Hard cheeses, Camembert and brie contain little or no lactose, but buttermilk has as much lactose as milk. Ice cream and cottage cheese have a little less.
Yogurt, too, is fairly rich in lactose but with an important difference. The bacterial cultures used to produce yogurt digest some of the lactose in the process. And if the yogurt is not reheated after it is produced, these bacteria will stay alive and assist your digestive process. Yogurt brands certified as containing ''live and active cultures'' by the National Yogurt Association will say so on the label. They include Dannon, Yoplait-Columbo, Haagen Dazs, Kraft and several store brands. Some that say they contain active cultures may have been reheated after the yogurt was made. Frozen yogurt, on the other hand, is repasteurized and may cause symptoms when consumed by those with a severe lactose intolerance.
If any amount of lactose causes problems, try the lactose-reduced dairy products now widely available in groceries. Or add the enzyme to any liquid milk product and let it stand in the refrigerator for 24 hours. Lactase tablets taken with any food containing lactose may also help. Both products are sold in pharmacies and health-food stores.",1997-05-28 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,lactose intolerance
175,How Lactase Works TO THE LIVING SECTION:,"Lactase is not a food, as was stated in the article ''Dairy Items for Those Who Can't Digest Milk'' (Aug. 15).
It is an enzyme that digests lactose from milk sugar into its component parts, glucose and galactose.
Lactase does its digestive work in the small intestine, not in the stomach. The undigested lactose passes from the small intestine to the large intestine, where bacteria ferment the lactose into organic acids and gases. The production of the acids and gases cause the bloating, gas and discomfort that are associated with lactose intolerance. ANDREA P. BOYER, Ph.D., R.D. Manhattan",1984-08-29 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,lactose intolerance
176,Study Detects Recent Instance of Human Evolution,"A surprisingly recent instance of human evolution has been detected among the peoples of East Africa. It is the ability to digest milk in adulthood, conferred by genetic changes that occurred as recently as 3,000 years ago, a team of geneticists has found.
The finding is a striking example of a cultural practice — the raising of dairy cattle — feeding back into the human genome. It also seems to be one of the first instances of convergent human evolution to be documented at the genetic level. Convergent evolution refers to two or more populations acquiring the same trait independently.
Throughout most of human history, the ability to digest lactose, the principal sugar of milk, has been switched off after weaning because there is no further need for the lactase enzyme that breaks the sugar apart. But when cattle were first domesticated 9,000 years ago and people later started to consume their milk as well as their meat, natural selection would have favored anyone with a mutation that kept the lactase gene switched on.
Such a mutation is known to have arisen among an early cattle-raising people, the Funnel Beaker culture, which flourished some 5,000 to 6,000 years ago in north-central Europe. People with a persistently active lactase gene have no problem digesting milk and are said to be lactose tolerant.",2006-12-10 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,lactose intolerance
177,Beware the Nocebo Effect,"EVERYONE knows that a placebo — a fake medication or sham procedure, typically used as a control in a medical trial — can nonetheless have a positive effect, relieving real symptoms like pain, bloating or a depressed mood. The placebo effect is a result of the patient’s expectation that the treatment will help.
But expectations can also do harm. When a patient anticipates a pill’s possible side effects, he can suffer them even if the pill is fake. This “nocebo” effect has been largely overlooked by researchers, clinicians and patients. In an article recently published in the journal Deutsche Ärzteblatt International, we and our colleague Ernil Hansen reviewed 31 studies, conducted by us and other researchers, that demonstrated the nocebo effect. We urge doctors and nurses to be more mindful of its dangers, particularly when informing patients about a treatment’s potential complications.
Consider the number of people in medical trials who, though receiving placebos, stop participating because of side effects. We found that 11 percent of people in fibromyalgia drug trials who were taking fake medication dropped out of the studies because of side effects like dizziness or nausea. Other researchers reported that the discontinuation rates because of side effects in placebo groups in migraine or tension drug trials were as much as 5 percent. Discontinuation rates in trials for statins ranged from 4 percent to 26 percent.
In a curious study, a team of Italian gastroenterologists asked people with and without diagnosed lactose intolerance to take lactose for an experiment on its effects on bowel symptoms. But in reality the participants received glucose, which does not harm the gut. Nonetheless, 44 percent of people with known lactose intolerance and 26 percent of those without lactose intolerance complained of gastrointestinal symptoms.",2012-08-10 20:04:36,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,lactose intolerance
178,What Really Causes Celiac Disease? - The New York Times,"WE know that the proteins called gluten, found in wheat and other grains, provoke celiac disease. And we know how to treat the illness: a gluten-free diet. But the rapidly increasing prevalence of celiac disease, which has quadrupled in the United States in just 50 years, is still mystifying.
Scientists are pursuing some intriguing possibilities. One is that breast-feeding may protect against the disease. Another is that we have neglected the teeming ecosystem of microbes in the gut — bacteria that may determine whether the immune system treats gluten as food or as a deadly invader.
Celiac disease is generally considered an autoimmune disorder. The name celiac derives from the Greek word for “hollow,” as in bowels. Gluten proteins in wheat, barley and rye prompt the body to turn on itself and attack the small intestine. Complications range from diarrhea and anemia to osteoporosis and, in extreme cases, lymphoma. Some important exceptions notwithstanding, the prevalence of celiac disease is estimated to range between 0.6 and 1 percent of the world’s population.
Nearly everyone with celiac disease has one of two versions of a cellular receptor called the human leukocyte antigen, or H.L.A. These receptors, the thinking goes, naturally increase carriers’ immune response to gluten.",2013-02-23 18:30:58,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,celiac disease
179,Should You Screen Your Child for Celiac Disease?,"The diagnosis dilemma
When people with celiac disease eat gluten, immune cells in their gut go into attack mode, producing antibodies and other molecules that cause inflammation. This, over time, can damage the intestines and block the absorption of nutrients.
In the simplest of terms, doctors diagnose the disease in three stages. First, they look for textbook symptoms such as abdominal pain, diarrhea, constipation and weight loss. Then, they do a blood test that scans for antibodies involved in the disease process, most often an antibody made against a protein called tissue transglutaminase, or TTG. If you test positive for the antibody and it’s at high enough levels, your doctor will likely then refer you to a gastroenterologist, who will perform an endoscopy and a biopsy — which involves taking small samples of bowel tissue to look for damage to structures called villi, which are tiny nubs of tissue that absorb nutrients from digested food. If the blood test and biopsy both indicate celiac disease, you have a definitive diagnosis and your doctor will probably instruct you to stop eating gluten, which should help you feel better.
But in many cases, diagnosis is much more complicated. First, symptoms can be ambiguous, ignored or even absent. “There is a large proportion of the population that has the disease without knowing it, either because they don’t have symptoms yet, or the symptoms are so vague they don’t pay attention to it,” said Dr. Alessio Fasano, M.D., director of the Center for Celiac Research and Treatment at Massachusetts General Hospital for Children in Boston.
Symptoms can take years to show up since, at first, only parts of the bowel may be affected and the rest may be compensating. In the meantime, you may assume that occasional stomachaches, gas or irregular bowel movements are normal, said Dr. Fasano. “But that could be the first sign that something’s going on.”
Early signs like these are even harder to nail down in kids. Some may only have rashes or joint pain, said Dr. Stahl. Or if they do have digestive symptoms, they may think they’re normal, and their parents may not be aware of them. “It can present in very minor ways like iron deficiency, headaches, tiredness, poor concentration, mild tummy pain and constipation,” said Dr. Justine Turner, M.D., a pediatric gastroenterologist at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada.
Pediatricians may assume a child’s celiac symptoms stem from more common conditions such as reflux, viral infections or run-of-the-mill constipation, and may not think to screen them. “Sometimes doctors forget,” said Dr. Turner.
Even when symptoms lead to testing, false results can derail diagnoses further. An initially negative endoscopy, as happened in Maddie’s case, may lead doctors to rule out celiac disease too early.",2020-04-17 21:36:06,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,celiac disease
180,Can Celiac Disease Affect the Brain?,"THE Mayo Clinic is on track to run 140,000 tests this year for autoimmune disorders of the brain, about a 20 percent increase over last year. One-tenth of samples usually come back positive for the self-directed antibodies indicative of autoimmunity, said Sean J. Pittock, a neurologist there. Many of these patients have cancers, which can trigger an attack. But a fraction have an autoimmune disease of the brain.
“There are people out there who are very ill and in nursing homes, and their condition is treatable and reversible,” he said. “And they’re being missed.” It’s rare, but he estimates these patients to number in the many thousands.
One such story comes from the journalist Susannah Cahalan whose memoir “Brain on Fire” details her bout with autoimmune encephalitis. Her sudden descent into “madness” resembled a psychotic break. And just a few years earlier, before the condition was understood to be autoimmune, she might have been considered lost to psychosis and institutionalized. But in 2009, Ms. Cahalan, the 217th patient to get the diagnosis of what’s called anti-NMDA receptor encephalitis, was treated for her autoimmune disorder and recovered.
Celiac disease differs from most other autoimmune diseases in one critical respect: The trigger, gluten, is known. And in most cases, removing gluten will turn off the autoimmune destruction in the gut. Around 10 percent of people with celiac disease, and possibly more, are thought to suffer neurological symptoms, ranging from headache and nerve pain, to ataxia and to epilepsy.
When I called Alessio Fasano, director of the Center for Celiac Research at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, he spoke of his own celiac-related miracle stories. In one, a boy with autism-like symptoms actually had undiagnosed celiac disease, and recovered on a gluten-free diet. Dr. Fasano told me he had seen a few similar cases in his native Italy.
In another, a former professor diagnosed with dementia and institutionalized, recovered on a gluten-free diet. Her doctors knew she had celiac disease, but thought it irrelevant to her degenerative brain disorder.
Some researchers have proposed autoimmune mechanisms to explain these phenomena. The presence of antibodies that bind to an enzyme called transglutaminase 2 is used to help diagnose celiac disease. Among other functions, transglutaminases help seal barriers in the body. Scientists at the Royal Hallamshire Hospital in Sheffield, Britain, have identified an antibody that binds to a version of transglutaminase, called TG6, which occurs primarily in the brain.",2014-10-11 15:58:12,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,celiac disease
181,The Expense of Eating With Celiac Disease,"“The most important thing to do after being diagnosed is to get a dietary consultation,” Dr. Murray said. With planning, you can learn to base your diet on fruits, vegetables, rice and potatoes. “I have some patients who rarely use those special gluten-free products,” he said.
Get in the habit of reading labels, advises Elaine Monarch, executive director of the Celiac Disease Foundation, a nonprofit organization in Studio City, Calif. Soy sauce, for instance, often has wheat protein as a filler. But Ms. Monarch found a brand of light soy sauce at her local grocery with no wheat that cost much less than one specifically marked as gluten-free. “There are often alternatives to specialty products, but you have to look,” she said.
Gluten-free bread is more expensive than traditional bread and often less palatable. And that holds for many gluten-free items. Some people, including Mr. Oram, end up buying a bread machine and making their own loaves. Nicole Hunn, who cooks gluten-free meals for her family of five and just started the Web site glutenfreeonashoestring.com, avoids mixes, which she says are expensive and not that tasty, and instead bakes with an all-purpose gluten-free flour from a company called Bob’s Red Mill, which can be used in place of wheat flour in standard recipes.
If you’re too busy to cook, look for well-priced gluten-free food at large chains like Whole Foods Market and Trader Joe’s. “Trader Joe’s now carries fantastic brown rice pasta that is reasonably priced and brown rice flour tortillas that can sub for bread with a variety of things,” says Kelly Courson, co-founder of the advice site CeliacChicks.com. Ms. Courson put out a Twitter message to her followers and learned that many were fans of DeBoles gluten-free pastas, which can be bought in bulk on Amazon, and puffed brown rice cereal by Alf’s Natural Nutrition, just $1 a bag at Wal-Mart.
Finally, it may be worthwhile to join a celiac support group. You can swap cost-cutting tips, share recipes and learn about new products. Many groups invite vendors to bring gluten-free products to meetings for members to sample  members can buy items they like at a discount and skip the shipping charges. Support groups typically have meetings, as well as newsletters and Web sites where you can post questions. Groups to check out include the Celiac Disease Foundation and the Gluten Intolerance Group of North America.
Finally, if you itemize your tax return and your total medical expenses for the year exceed 7.5 percent of your adjusted gross income, you can write off certain expenses associated with celiac disease. You can deduct the excess cost of a gluten-free product over a comparable gluten-containing product.
Let’s say you spend $6.50 on a loaf of gluten-free bread, and a regular loaf costs $4; you can deduct $2.50. In addition, you can deduct the cost of products necessary to maintain a gluten-free diet, like xanthan gum for baking. If you mail order gluten-free products, the shipping costs may be deductible, too. If you have to travel extra miles to buy gluten-free goods, the mileage is also deductible. You’ll need a doctor’s letter to confirm your diagnosis and your need for a gluten-free diet, and you should save receipts in case of a tax audit.",2009-08-14 15:19:24,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,celiac disease
182,A Debilitating Disease That Is Often Unknown,"“It was like doping,” Winsberg, 42, said. “Suddenly I was running six-minute miles instead of nine-minute miles. Before I had placed in the bottom third in triathlons. Four weeks gluten free, and I placed second in a triathlon. It was like reverse aging. I went from feeling 38 to 28 to 18.”
Winsberg’s transformation did not surprise Dr. John Reasoner, a medical director with the United States Olympic Committee.
“In six to eight weeks, if they’ve followed the diet, it’s night and day,” he said.
Reasoner said that symptoms of celiac disease were often subtle but came at a high cost for athletes who expected maximum performance. Dave Hahn, who has reached the Mount Everest summit 10 times, said he found he had the disease after he became “inexplicably weak” on his second trip to the peak in 1999.
Hahn was the climbing leader on a search expedition for the remains of the Everest pioneer George Mallory, who had disappeared on the mountain in 1924. The search was successful, but Hahn struggled. Then 37, he had become anemic. Perilously weak and short of breath on summit day, he had to depend on his climbing partner to make it off the summit alive.
“It was a huge source of shame which made me feel like I had to get to the bottom of the health problems that I’d been ignoring for so long,” Hahn said.
He returned to the doctor he had seen eight years before for chronic gastrointestinal problems, common in celiacs, and this time she diagnosed the disease.
Hahn said he had difficulty adjusting to the gluten-free diet.
“I got stronger again without question, and you don’t really expect that in your late 30s,” he said. “I had gotten to the point up high and in the cold where I completely ran out of gas.”",2008-10-10 01:54:14,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,celiac disease
183,TROPICAL SPRUE LINKED TO ALGAE,"The doctors looked at the in testinal biopsies of 14 sprue cases at Lincoln Hospital over the last six years plus 10 other cases from Morrisania, Monte fiore and Bronx Veteran Admin istration hospitals.
The biopsies did not show the alga, but they did show tiny pairs of black dots. A biopsy is an examination, usually microscopic of tissue removed from an organ.
The doctors sent for a live subculture of the suspected alga from the Algal Culture Center of Indiana University, which is a resource center for the West ern Hemisphere. Dr. Bailey K. Ashford had deposited the specimens discovered in two sprue patients in Puerto Rico more than 40 years before.
When the researchers put the alga into human serum—the celless, liquid part of the blood they found pairs of black dots that looked identical to the ones found in the biopsies.
They found that these paired bodies—never before seen in this alga—were able to kill the diving cells of mammals in the laboratory. This was an impor tant finding, since it is known that the intestinal lining of sprue patients is destroyed, in terfering with the absorption of food.
But could the alga cause dis ease in man?
A physician who knows the disease volunteered to be the guinea pig.

184,Abdominal Attacks,"1. Symptoms
The stomach pain would come with unbearable intensity, last a day or two and disappear. ""I just can't go on this way."" The patient, a tall, gaunt teenager with a short, dark crew cut and a worried look on his face, spoke quietly but with a sense of urgency. ""My stomach -- it hurts me so much. I can't go back to college until I know what's happening."" His mother, young and slim and clearly anxious, nodded. ""It's been going on too long,"" she added. Dr. Kiran Sachdev, a gastroenterologist, agreed. It had been going on far too long.
The patient first came to see her three months earlier. He described attacks of intense abdominal pain that he got every couple of months or so. The pain was sharp, he said, unrelenting. During these attacks he couldn't eat, he couldn't walk, he could barely stand. Then, after a couple of days, he would get better. He didn't know what brought on the pain or why it went away. But it had been going on for almost a decade, and he just wanted it to stop.
It all seemed to start after his appendix ruptured when he was 11, his mother told Sachdev. He needed two operations and was in the hospital for almost three weeks. A month or so later, her son had his first attack of this mysterious pain. Initially, they went to the E.R. with every severe episode. The doctors there never figured out what was wrong, so eventually they just dealt with it at home. A few years later, during a particularly bad episode, his mother took him once more to the emergency room. A surgeon there told her that the scars from his appendicitis could be causing the bouts of pain by intermittently blocking his digestive tract, a relatively common complication of abdominal surgery. He recommended another operation to remove the scar tissue. Less than a month after the patient had that operation, the pain came back -- just as bad as ever. The surgeon was baffled. ""He told me I wasn't eating enough fiber, but I knew that wasn't right,"" the young man said. He tried Metamucil and increased the fiber in his diet, but the attacks kept coming. Despite these recurrent episodes, he graduated from high school and started college.
2. Investigation
Away at school, he continued to have attacks. During his first two years there, he told Sachdev, he probably spent more time sick in bed than actually sitting in class. But he was determined not to let the attacks limit him.",2006-03-19 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,sprue
185,"PERSONAL HEALTH; With This Disorder, No Cheating on the Diet","But thanks to the efforts of others with the disorder, www.celiac.com offers reliable information along with hundreds of gluten-free recipes and products and their vendors.
A Variable Condition
As Mr. Hallick's case demonstrates, properly diagnosing celiac disease can be tricky. No two patients are alike, not even in the same family. In some people, the disorder shows up in infancy, as soon as the baby starts eating cereal. In others, symptoms first appear in adulthood, activated perhaps by surgery, pregnancy, severe emotional stress or a viral infection. Still others show few if any symptoms until serious bodily damage has occurred.
Here are possible symptoms, provided by the National Institutes of Health: recurring abdominal bloating and pain; chronic diarrhea; weight loss; pale, foul-smelling stool; unexplained anemia; excessive gas; bone pain; behavior changes; muscle cramps; fatigue; irritability or depression; delayed growth; failure to thrive in infants; joint pain; seizures; tingling numbness in the legs (from nerve damage); pale sores inside the mouth; a painful skin rash called dermatitis herpetiformis; tooth discoloration or loss of enamel, and missed menstrual periods (due to excessive weight loss).
As is evident, the symptoms may or may not involve the digestive tract. In fact, in children, chronic irritability is a common symptom. The symptoms of celiac disease are also shared by other conditions, including irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis, diverticulosis, intestinal infections, chronic fatigue syndrome and depression.
Untreated celiac disease often causes lactose intolerance, resulting in flatulence and diarrhea when dairy products are consumed.
Before a definitive diagnosis of these other conditions is made, it may be wise to have the patient's blood tested for antibodies to gluten -- antigliadin, antiendomysium and antireticulin. And when a family member is found to have celiac disease, other close relatives should be tested, since about 10 percent of a celiac patients' parents, siblings or children will also have the condition.
Because most doctors in this country still believe celiac disease is rare, they have a low index of suspicion, with the result that on average there is about a 10-year lapse between the first symptoms and a correct diagnosis. Thus, it may be up to patients to suggest the possibility of celiac disease when baffling symptoms occur.",2002-04-23 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,sprue
186,A Disease That Responds to a Diet of Foods Free of Gluten,"With celiac disease in children, growth may be stunted, and there may be developmental delay or behavioral changes and neurological complications like seizures. In adults, the disease may lead to fatigue, bone pain, anemia, neurological problems, depression or infertility, which can be traced to nutritional deficiencies. If left untreated, celiac disease can lead to osteoporosis, chronic ill health and malignancy. Treatment includes a gluten-free diet, which can restore health but not rid the patient of the disease.
Macie is thriving on her gluten-free diet.
''Celiac disease is a very gratifying disease to diagnose because you can see a patient who is extraordinarily ill, and two weeks later they're healthy,'' said Dr. Stuart H. Berezin, a pediatric gastroenterologist at Westchester County Medical Center.
Six years ago, Sue Goldstein of White Plains said she had an overwhelming feeling that her body was dying and she thought it was linked to depression. But she was told she had celiac disease, which she calls ''the disease with a happy ending.''
Mrs. Goldstein started her own support group when she discovered Westchester did not have one. Five years ago, she held the first meeting in her living room and 9 people attended. More than 200 members are in the group now, and meetings are held at Phelps Memorial Hospital in Sleepy Hollow.
Mrs. Goldstein and Lou Zimmet of Peekskill, membership chairwoman of the group, spend hours on the phone each day, counseling men and women who learn that they or a family member have the disease. ''When people have first been diagnosed, they're feeling very ill,'' Mrs. Goldstein said. ''It helps to have the reassurance that they're going to feel better.''
The support group organized a Westchester Celiac Conference Day last fall, which attracted 380 people. The conference offered free blood screening to relatives of those attending the conference. Mrs. Goldstein's daughter, Laura, a senior at Tufts University in Medford, Mass., found through the blood screening at the conference that she had the disease. Until the daughter had been symptom free, although she had felt tired and sluggish.
Her blood test needed to be followed by a biopsy. To insure an accurate diagnosis, the daughter was told to continue eating gluten so that the damage to her small intestine could be seen.",1998-01-04 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,sprue
187,Gluten and Gluttony,"Q. Other than celiac disease, is there any reason to avoid gluten in the diet?
A. “Though the hype continues on gluten-free diets being the panacea for all ills, science still lags behind in concrete evidence supporting this belief,” said Dr. Vandana Nehra, a gastroenterologist who specializes in celiac disease at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.
Dr. Nehra said it was “unclear if the benefit of a strict gluten-free diet in conditions other than celiac sprue may be related to the avoidance of carbohydrates and thus eventually to weight control” or was “merely a placebo effect as individuals feel better eating a healthier diet.”

189,"Why Did This Man Lose His Memory, Words and Even His Ability to Walk?","Dr. Andrew Hale was the infectious-disease specialist in training assigned to the case. After looking through all the patient’s tests and examining him, Hale didn’t think the patient had Whipple’s. Ninety percent of patients with Whipple’s suffer from joint pain and diarrhea. As far as anyone could tell, this patient had neither. And in more than 90 percent of patients who have Whipple’s in their brain, as the M.R.I. suggested was the situation with this man, the bacteria will be detectable in the spinal fluid. Based on the test, this was not a case of Whipple’s.
If not Whipple’s, what was causing the patient to have this extreme cognitive and physical breakdown? The medical team suggested a brain biopsy. They knew there was something abnormal in the patient’s brain. They could see where it was. Examining the affected brain tissue should give them the cause of this man’s rapid decline.
The patient’s daughter was worried, but Hale persuaded her that this was the best way to help her father. Using CT images, the neurosurgeons were able to identify exactly where in the brain they would find the affected tissue. In the operating room, they shaved a small area of scalp just over the patient’s ear and drilled a hole about the size of a dime. A needle was carefully introduced into the brain and then guided to the affected area by real-time X-ray images. A small sample of tissue was extracted and immediately taken to the lab. If the tissue was completely normal, they would need to get a second sample.
An Answer in Brain Tissue
The brain tissue was not normal, though it took days to find out what the patient had. Remarkably, it really was Whipple’s disease — the sample sent to pathology was brimming with the tiny bacteria that cause this terrible and destructive infection.
If his brain was filled with all these bacteria, why had all the previous tests been negative? In medicine, no test is 100 percent accurate. A test on spinal fluid correctly eliminates the possibility of Whipple’s 97 percent of the time. But that statistic, as impressive as it is, also means that for every 100 people with negative tests, three will actually have the infection, and the test will miss it. And this, Hale reasoned, was one such case. If the bug was found in the affected parts of the brain, the patient must have the infection.
The patient was immediately started on intravenous antibiotics. After four weeks, he was changed to an oral regimen. It is so difficult to eliminate this bacterium and prevent a recurrence that the current recommendation is to treat the patient for one to two years at least and to consider treating for life. This patient has been on these medications for nearly two years. His recovery has been slow but significant. He can walk, though he needs a cane. He can talk. He dresses and feeds himself. When he saw Hale at the end of March, he even made a few jokes. He still needs round-the-clock care. He’s still forgetful and sometimes confused. He has made progress, but it’s a very long road back.",2017-04-13 09:00:03,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,whipple disease

The most common operation is called the Whipple procedure, and it is a long, difficult operation that usually involves removing parts of the pancreas, stomach, small intestine and other organs. Thirty years ago the operation itself had a death rate of 20 percent to 30 percent, and many doctors refused to recommend it even though it offered the only hope of a cure. But surgeons have improved the operation greatly over the years, and the mortality now is very low - in the right hands. Studies have shown that success rates are significantly higher at hospitals that do many of these operations.
Researchers always hope that finding a gene will lead them to a treatment that is able to kill or block the growth of cancer cells while leaving healthy cells unharmed. But only a few such ""targeted"" or ""smart"" drugs have been found.
Gloria Petersen, an epidemiologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, works in the field but was cautious about what such research might yield. ""Look at the colon cancer and breast cancer story. They're still struggling, in terms of a target for therapy,"" she said.
Other research involves the tumor cells themselves. Cancers may have their own stem cells - a distinct, uniquely powerful subset of cells that cause most of a tumor's growth and spread, and that seem invulnerable to chemotherapy and radiation. These cells could explain why some patients relapse even after treatment shrinks their tumors: drugs and radiation kill ordinary cancer cells, but the stem cells somehow survive and grow.
Studies have found evidence of these stem cells in blood, breast and brain cancers. In February, researchers at the University of Michigan reported in the journal Cancer Research that they had found the cells in tumors from people with pancreatic cancer. Implanted in mice, the stem cells were 100 times more likely than ordinary cancer cells to grow into tumors.
""We need to identify these small numbers of cells within a cancer, like we have,"" said Dr. Diane Simeone, the senior author of the paper. ""We need to better characterize them, and then we can figure out ways to selectively target or eradicate them.""",2007-08-08 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,whipple disease

Mrs. Martin, who works as a dressmaker, had immediate surgery, called a Whipple procedure, to remove parts of her pancreas and the surrounding organs. She then underwent a year of chemotherapy and radiation treatments. Eight years after the diagnosis, Mrs. Martin remains free of cancer.
She volunteers for the Pancreatic Cancer Action Network, helping to raise money for research and providing support for other patients.

193,"Deadly Inheritance, Desperate Trade-Off","“When I started 30 years ago, people said you couldn’t treat advanced colon cancer, and now mortality is dropping in both genders, and the incidence is dropping with screening,” Dr. Mayer said. “I wouldn’t have believed it was possible. Nothing says we can’t do this in pancreatic cancer. It’s just more of a challenge.”

The first symptom of pancreatic cancer is often pain, because the tumors invade nerve clusters. Nausea, weight loss and jaundice may also occur.
“It’s a characteristic pain that goes almost to people’s backs,” Dr. Mayer said. “Years before CT scans, routine studies never found an explanation for that pain, and there was an apocryphal belief that the patients had depression, and depression led to pancreatic cancer. They would have weight loss and ill-defined pain and be sent to a psychiatrist, and later found to have pancreatic cancer. Now, this sort of pain syndrome leads to a CT scan.”
The only people who are cured or live more than a few years with this cancer have operable tumors — and not even all of them make it. About 15 percent to 20 percent of patients have surgery, and only about a quarter of them are cured. A recent report by the American College of Surgeons said that doctors are failing to offer the surgery to many patients who are candidates for it.
When the tumors are inoperable, it is often because they have invaded blood vessels and nerves. People who cannot be helped by surgery are usually given chemotherapy, which can slow the disease down for a while but not cure it.

“I would go to a place that does this often,” Dr. Mayer said. “Compelling data indicate it, and reluctantly, I think, the general community has agreed. Ten or 15 places around the country have enormous experience, and I think it behooves one to go to a recognized cancer center. One might go to a perfectly fine community hospital for most other surgery, but I wouldn’t do it for this.”",2007-08-07 04:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,whipple disease
194,"Doctors Discover New Worm, One That's Lethal to Humans","The scientists who solved the puzzle are from both Stanford and the Kaiser-Permanente Medical Center in Santa Clara, Calif. The authors said they did not find the entire worm, which has not been named, but identified it from fragments by using the genetic techniques.
The scientists do not know how often the new worm causes disease in humans and where the microbe exists in nature, Dr. David Relman, a co-author, said in an interview.
In recent years, scientists have identified a number of new microbes, including one called cyclospora, which is causing intestinal illness in at least 11 states. Health officials have tentatively linked many such cases to eating fresh fruits like raspberries and strawberries.
The man who died from the worm infection was a 44-year-old accountant from the San Francisco Bay area who had been infected with the AIDS virus for five years. He often went camping in California and had two dogs but had never traveled outside the United States.
In early 1994 he began suffering pain in his abdomen and back, weight loss, sweating at night and fever. After the man was admitted to the hospital in Santa Clara in March, his abdomen swelled as the worm invaded and destroyed parts of his intestine and liver. Doctors initially thought he had developed one of the many types of cancer that often complicate the course of someone with AIDS. Shortly before his deaths nine weeks later, doctors performed a surgical procedure to remove tissue from his abdomen.",1996-06-28 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,whipple disease
195,On Language; Name That Disease,"AN IRISH PHYSICIAN named Robert James Graves, poking around various glands in 1835, may not have been the first to describe the exophthalmic goiter, but he gave the most accurate early account of what we now call a hyperthyroid condition; as a result, the imbalance of secretion from which President Bush has been suffering, and which led to his heart fibrillation, is called Graves' disease .
I think the grammatical diagnosis is wrong. A second opinion: punctuate it Graves's disease , with an apostrophe followed by an s . No matter what it says in Merriam-Webster's Medical Desk Dictionary or in Webster's New World Dictionary, the possessive of a proper name ending in s should be formed by adding an apostrophe and another s . Maintain standards, as they say at the Court of St. James's. (Lowercase the d in disease ; the lexicographers have that right.)
You have to watch these doctors when it comes to naming diseases, treatments and medications; it's sometimes hard to tell what motivates them. As a longtime political hawk, I liked the choice of the name for an anticoagulant discovered when University of Wisconsin researchers were examining spoiled sweet clover as the cause of hemorrhage in cattle; the doctors called it warfarin , and it was officially so named by Du Pont. But it had nothing to do with a war on bleeding; the bellicose warfarin is based on the acronym WARF, from Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation. (President Bush is using medication like this today.)

196,ENCOUNTERS; 'It Was All a Kind of Enchantment',"It is with a certain sadness that she tell me how his son Christian had asked that the painting ""be sent back up the creek,"" when finally, because it was so large it could not have been taken up to storage in its frame, they gave him the choice of having it rolled up, ""which surely would have ruined it,"" or cutting it in half so that only the upper portion of the portrait could continue to be shown. It was only years later that they learned that the painting had never even been picked up, that when it finally was retrieved, it was cut up so that its back made many, many canvases. Sadness and Humor
There is a mixture of sadness and humor in her voice as she speaks, and as she tells me the story of the dreaming Mrs. Lorenzo E. Woodhouse, who, in this era when so many had lost their fortunes in the stock market crash and were just barely hanging on, would build the opulent Guild Hall, who was to become Enez Whipple's mentor and very close friend.
""By the time I arrived,"" she says almost wistfully, ""instead of 20 gardeners, Mrs. Woodhouse was down to two or three.""
The tale of Guild Hall begins, ironically, with Mrs. Woodhouse's decision to restore the Clinton Academy, an old school building on Main Street, East Hampton, to make it into a museum for housing local antiquities. As the dream of the museum filled her, in her desire for authenticity, she thought nothing about eliminating a later added wing where people used to come to play basketball, where amateur theater and community meetings would take place. Even as the museum filled up with the elegant woodwork and old furniture that it still houses today, the community for which it was supposedly built retreated.
It was once again in an effort to reinterest and reinvolve the community that Mrs. Woodhouse decided to build Guild Hall across the way, as a place where community theater would be combined with meeting spaces and there would even be a gallery for showing local art. However, once again her love of elegance and opulence got in the way. She couldn't resist making everything as elegant as possible, so that the theater became a sparkling architectural gem, in grand Elizabethan style. The galleries were crystalline and regal and forbidding. While the Rollins Company Dancers wafted across the manicured lawns, and while the very rich conservative painters showed their floor-to-ceiling self-portraits, once again the community stayed away. Anm Auspicious Start
It was into this scene that Enez Whipple entered in 1941, when all but Mrs. Woodhouse were engaged in the war effort and Mrs. Woodhouse felt herself increasingly alone with her grand enterprises. With the fading of attention to cultural pursuits and impractical dreams, here came the girl from the village of farmers and paper mill workers who would know how to talk to the potato farmers, who would know how to persuade whoever she found in the grocery store to try to be in a play.
As one sits with Enez in the realm of the pink and the yellow, and one shares her reminiscences of what Mrs. Woodhouse's parties meant to the young woman from the country, we must picture the older Mrs. Woodhouse taking the young Enez Whipple through the sparkling theater and through gilded rooms telling the tales of why she built Guild Hall. We must try to imagine what the two women meant to each other.",1994-07-10 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,whipple disease
197,Small Advances Against Pancreatic Cancer,"Men and women are equally at risk, although there are somewhat more cases among men, probably because more men smoked. The disease is also more common among African-Americans than whites, partly because black men have higher rates of smoking and diabetes, and black women higher rates of obesity.

A Genetic Component
Five to 10 percent of pancreatic cancer patients have a family history of the disease and are presumed to carry mutations that impair their body’s ability to repair damage to DNA. Several such mutations have been identified and linked to an increased risk of developing pancreatic cancer. In families where four or more members have had the disease, the risk to others in the family can be as high as 57 times that of people with no such family history, Dr. Manuel Hidalgo of Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine reported in April in The New England Journal of Medicine.
In a rare hereditary example, researchers led by Dr. Teresa A. Brentnall of the University of Washington School of Medicine described a family in which nine blood relatives had died of pancreatic cancer, some at young ages. Through detailed molecular detective work, they identified a mutation in a gene called Palladin in all those with cancer or precancer of the pancreas that was lacking in other family members. A still-healthy relative with this mutation chose to have his pancreas removed when it was found to harbor precancerous changes, and he has remained cancer-free for more than 14 years.
In an interview, Dr. Brentnall said that unraveling how the Palladin mutation works helped explain why this cancer is usually so deadly. “Pancreatic cancer cells are surrounded by a dense layer of fibroblasts,” she said, adding that in nonfamilial pancreatic cancer, the Palladin protein “makes the fibroblasts grow little feet filled with poisonous enzymes that create holes through which the cancer cells can escape and invade blood vessels very early in the disease, before the tumor is of significant size.”
Thus, the cancer is typically metastatic and incurable by the time it is diagnosed.
Adding to the problem of early diagnosis is the lack of a reliable screening test and the vagueness of early symptoms, if any. Without a family history that might prompt a doctor to suspect pancreatic cancer, patients are often first checked for problems like chronic reflux, gallbladder disease and bowel disorders.
For those with a family history of pancreatic cancer, Dr. Brentnall and other experts at leading medical centers now offer screening tests, including an endoscopic ultrasound exam, to look for abnormalities in the pancreas that may herald precancerous changes. But such exams are not cost-effective screening tools for the general population.
As with patients with the Palladin mutation, those on the verge of developing cancer are offered surgery to remove the pancreas, which results in diabetes and a lifetime dependence on daily insulin injections.",2010-06-07 16:54:37,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,whipple disease
198,"The Damage of Reflux (Bile, Not Acid)","No one with bile reflux needs to just wait for worse to come, although the remedies are not as simple and well known as they are for acid reflux. The condition usually can be managed with medications, but severe cases may require surgery.
Image
Symptoms and Causes
Both acid reflux and bile reflux may afflict the same person, which can make diagnosis a challenge. But the stomach inflammation that results from bile reflux often causes a burning or gnawing pain in the upper abdomen that is not felt with acid reflux, according to experts at the Mayo Clinic. Other symptoms of bile reflux may include frequent heartburn (the main symptom of acid reflux), nausea, vomiting bile, sometimes a cough or hoarseness and unintended weight loss.
A brief anatomy lesson makes the problem easier to understand. The main organs of the digestive tract are separated by valvelike tissues that, when functioning properly, allow food and digestive fluids to pass in only one direction: down. Thus, as food and liquids pass through the digestive process, they normally travel from the mouth to the throat, then down the esophagus into the stomach, and finally into the small intestine. The opening between the esophagus and stomach, a muscular ring called the lower esophageal sphincter, is meant to keep stomach acid from backing up. When it malfunctions, acid reflux  chronic heartburn  is the usual result.
Likewise, the pyloric valve, the muscular ring between the stomach and small intestine, is supposed to open just enough to permit a fraction of an ounce of liquefied food to pass into the small intestine, but not enough to allow bile to back up into the stomach. When this valve fails to close properly, refluxed bile can cause gastritis, an irritation and inflammation of the stomach lining. Untreated, that can result in a bleeding ulcer or even stomach cancer.
If the esophageal sphincter malfunctions at the same time, or there is a build-up of pressure in the stomach, bile and acid can reach the lower portion of the esophagus, inflaming the delicate lining of this organ. If the problem persists, it can cause scarring that narrows the esophagus, which may result in choking, or the cellular abnormality called Barrett’s esophagus, which can become precancerous and eventually develop into cancer that is nearly always fatal.
Gastroenterologists have recently demonstrated that Barrett’s esophagus can often be effectively treated with radiofrequency therapy, which might help patients like Mrs. Kozma.
Bile reflux can occur as a complication of certain surgeries, like the gallbladder surgery Mrs. Kozma underwent. More often, though, damage to the pyloric valve results from gastric surgery  total removal of the stomach or the gastric bypass operation used to treat morbid obesity.",2009-06-29 20:53:36,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,whipple disease
199,CASES; Rare Tumor Is Deceptive And Deadly,"''Do you have flushing?'' the gastroenterologist repeatedly asked my wife early last year. Days before, she had had a routine colonoscopy, and now the doctor was asking her if her face was turning bright red, and if she was sweating uncontrollably. Except for a few gastrointestinal problems over the years, Carol felt fine. But she wasn't. She had cancer.
Thinking she had an irritable bowel, the doctor had directed the probe a few inches into her small intestine. A small, one centimeter nodule -- a polyp, he figured -- was found and biopsied. It was not a polyp, but a rare carcinoid tumor.
Carcinoid tumors often take years to develop, so the disease is called ''cancer in slow motion.'' Dave Thomas, the founder of Wendy's hamburger chain, had a carcinoid tumor for 10 years until it metastasized into his liver and contributed to his death in January. (The cause was widely cited as liver cancer, with no mention of the carcinoid tumor.)
My wife, Carol, was very lucky. Her carcinoid tumor was found by accident, and it was just one centimeter in diameter. ''With carcinoid tumors that small, 'cure' is a fair word to use,'' said her physician, Dr. Anthony Heaney, who is setting up a carcinoid treatment center at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles.",2002-03-26 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,carcinoid tumor
200,"Two Naked Mole Rats, Seemingly Immune to Cancer, Got Cancer","As it turns out, not even naked mole rats are totally immune to cancer.
Researchers had never reported finding the deadly disease in the long-living rodents — not in the wild, or in zoos. Even after injecting their cells with the same viruses that trigger tumors in mice, the pink, wrinkly-skinned critters came out just fine. That is until earlier this month when a team of pathologists reported finding two cases of cancer in mole rats housed in zoos.
Does this cancel out the possibility that naked mole rats may hold a clue to fighting cancer? Not at all, said Martha Delaney, a veterinary pathologist at the University of Washington School of Medicine and lead author on the study, which was published in the journal Veterinary Pathology earlier this month. Rather, she said, these particular cases, one of glandular cancer and another of stomach cancer, may provide additional clues as to what makes mole rats so much less susceptible to cancer than other rodents and species with long life spans.
“Now that we have two naked mole rats with cancer,” she said in an email, “we can study the colonies from which they came to elucidate why they are cancer prone, compared to other zoo and research colonies.”
Dr. Delaney and her colleagues have studied lesions on naked mole rats for more than a decade, but it wasn’t until last fall when they came across their first cancerous case. Veterinarians from the Brookfield Zoo in Chicago sent the team a dark red and purple mass that was removed from the armpit of a 22-year-old male naked mole rat. Dr. Delaney’s team identified it as a malignant tumor and diagnosed adenocarcinoma, a type of cancer that develops from the body’s mucus-secreting glands, like the salivary glands or mammary glands.",2016-02-19 19:26:15,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,carcinoid tumor
201,Hindsight Is Kind to Steve Jobs’s Decision to Delay Surgery,"Was Steve Jobs a smart guy who made a stupid decision when it came to his health?
It might seem so, from the broad outlines of what he did in 2003 when a CT scan and other tests found a cancerous tumor in his pancreas. Doctors urged him to have an operation to remove the tumor, but Mr. Jobs put it off and instead tried a vegan diet, juices, herbs, acupuncture and other alternative remedies.
Nine months later, the tumor had grown. Only then did he agree to surgery, during which his doctors found that the cancer had spread to his liver, according to the new biography by Walter Isaacson. Cancer eventually killed him.
The sequence of events has given rise to news articles and blogs based on 20/20 hindsight, speculating that if only Mr. Jobs had had the surgery right away, doctors could have caught the cancer early, before it spread, and saved him.
But there is no way in this life to know what might have been — not in politics, baseball, romance or the stock market, and certainly not in sickness and health. Mr. Jobs’s wish to avoid or delay surgery was not unusual. And given the type of tumor he had and the way it was found, his decision to wait may not have been as ill considered as it seems at first blush.",2011-10-31 20:06:53,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,carcinoid tumor
202,Think Like a Doctor: A Terrible Stomachache,"He listened patiently, interrupting only occasionally to ask a question or two. In looking at the patient he could see how much she’d been affected by this pain. She was terribly thin. And the way her clothes fit suggested that she’d lost the weight recently.
When he examined the patient, she pointed to the spot where she felt her recurring pain. She could locate it easily — a few inches above her belly button and slightly to the right. The doctor gently placed his stethoscope over the spot, listening for what’s called a bruit, the noise blood makes when its flow is turbulent. There is an unusual disorder known as median arcuate ligament syndrome, in which one of the main arteries leading to the intestines is compressed against the diaphragm by this ligament, which connects the left and right sides of the diaphragm. The compression intermittently reduces blood flow, and that could make this kind of noise. But he heard nothing.
The patient’s husband pointed to a couple of other spots where he’d felt lumps or bumps. The doctor felt the spots. The first was her aorta, the vessel that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body. The second, a little higher up and off to the side, was her backbone. That’s how thin she was.
Another Round of Testing
After the exam the doctor shared his thinking. A rare type of growth called a gastrointestinal stromal tumor, or GIST, was a possibility. A carcinoid tumor — also rare — could present with this type of intermittent pain. A more common possibility was Crohn’s disease. Though Crohn’s usually caused chronic diarrhea, it could also present with pain alone. To look for these conditions he would order a special type of CT scan, one that could give them a good look at the structure of the bowel wall, especially in the small intestines.
He also wanted to check the levels of certain vitamins — particularly those absorbed in the small intestine. She had been given a diagnosis of a vitamin B12 deficiency some years ago and he wanted to see if she had some difficulty absorbing other vitamins as well.
Normal Tests, but Still in Pain
When those studies were all normal, the doctor had to rethink her case. In two CT scans she’d had a lot of stool in the colon. Could this be a motility problem?
The doctor ordered a gastric transit study to see if there was some problem with her gut’s ability to move food forward through the system. And finally something was abnormal. The food slowed down just a little as it passed through her intestines. She had something known as gastroparesis. Most of the time the cause is never found. And often, it never goes away.",2016-10-06 14:00:06,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,carcinoid tumor
203,"When Medicine Errs -- A special report.; At Roosevelt Hospital, 3 Deaths Lead to 3 Different Responses","In Mrs. Robins's case, Dr. Thys said, those precautions were not taken. After the woman was sedated and the breathing tube was inserted, her heart rate suddenly slowed, then quickened, then stopped. Attempts to resuscitate her were futile and she died in the operating room.
The hospital's internal report of the incident found ""the standard of care not met"" in this case. Those deceptively mild words are among the strongest used in the medical community for questionable treatment of a patient. Specifically, the report said, the likelihood of complications from the carcinoid tumor was not properly evaluated, and during the operation the patient was not treated with medication that might have reversed the effects.
Dr. Thys agreed that a mistake had been made. ""If a lesson is to be learned out of this,"" he said, ""it's that if another carcinoid patient ever has to come to the operating room, we will take every precaution.""
Even so, the anesthesiologist in the case, Dr. Eric Kincaid, was not disciplined or required to take continuing medical education courses. In addition, the incident was never reported to the Health Department. State law requires the reporting of any unexpected deaths, or deaths that may have resulted from hospital or doctor error. 'Death Was Not Unexpected'
Dr. Thys said this incident is different from the other two, because, although an error occurred, the patient's health was extremely poor and the error could therefore not be blamed for her death. ""We felt the death was not unexpected given the course of her illness,"" he said.
Dr. Kincaid declined to be interviewed for this article. The Department of Health disagreed with the hospital's evaluation of the seriousness of the case. Alerted to the incident while investigating the death of Mr. Sklar, the department has cited Roosevelt for failing to report Mrs. Robins's death. Peter Slocum, a spokesman for the department, said a full review of the case is under way.
According to Dr. Thys, Mrs. Robins's family was not told of the findings of the hospital's investigation. Nor, to his knowledge, were they told everything that happened in the operating room. Attempts by a reporter to locate her family were unsuccessful.
When her relatives were told she had died during the procedure, they were ""relieved,"" Dr. Thys said, because she was ""out of her pain.""",1992-11-12 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,carcinoid tumor
204,Higher Risk of Rare Cancer Found for Vietnam Veterans,"A long-awaited Federal study released today said that Vietnam veterans had a higher risk of contracting a rare cancer but that the risk could not be linked to exposure to the herbicide Agent Orange.
The cancer, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, was one of six cancers chosen for study because veterans' groups had expressed concern about their incidence in those who served in Vietnam. But there was no evidence that Vietnam veterans had higher rates of the five other cancers, the study said. And the rates of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma were highest in veterans with presumably low exposure to the herbicide, which was used to defoliate trees and plants to deprive the enemy of cover.
But researchers, veterans' groups and the Department of Veterans Affairs all said the study and previous Federal studies had not resolved the question of whether use of the herbicide in the Vietnam War was responsible for cancer or other serious health problems. The study was conducted by the Centers for Disease Control.
The veterans' department, responding to the study, announced that it would honor disability claims related to non-Hodgkin's lymphoma from veterans who served in Vietnam and adjacent waters. Some of the claims are among 36,000 previously denied because the department would not honor claims based on exposure to Agent Orange. But the department said there was still no evidence that the defoliant was the cause of the cancer.",1990-03-30 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,carcinoid tumor

206,"Cancers Can Vanish Without Treatment, but How?","Call it the arrow of cancer. Like the arrow of time, it was supposed to point in one direction. Cancers grew and worsened.
But as a paper in The Journal of the American Medical Association noted last week, data from more than two decades of screening for breast and prostate cancer call that view into question. Besides finding tumors that would be lethal if left untreated, screening appears to be finding many small tumors that would not be a problem if they were left alone, undiscovered by screening. They were destined to stop growing on their own or shrink, or even, at least in the case of some breast cancers, disappear.
“The old view is that cancer is a linear process,” said Dr. Barnett Kramer, associate director for disease prevention at the National Institutes of Health. “A cell acquired a mutation, and little by little it acquired more and more mutations. Mutations are not supposed to revert spontaneously.”
So, Dr. Kramer said, the image was “an arrow that moved in one direction.” But now, he added, it is becoming increasingly clear that cancers require more than mutations to progress. They need the cooperation of surrounding cells and even, he said, “the whole organism, the person,” whose immune system or hormone levels, for example, can squelch or fuel a tumor.",2009-10-26 19:51:57,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,carcinoid tumor
207,"A Mother, a Sick Son and His Father, the Priest","Illness and Mounting Costs
With the costs mounting for chemotherapy, radiation and craniotomies, Ms. Bond again turned to the church. The Franciscans agreed to pay 50 percent of any “extraordinary” medical costs, until he turned 23. Ms. Bond said she was greatly relieved. She was involved in a messy divorce with her third husband, and could not go back to work because caring for her son had become a full-time job.
She finally found a doctor at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City who proposed an experimental treatment on Nathan’s tumors, which had returned despite all the previous treatments. They flew to New York for a one-week consultation, and ended up staying for three months while he was in and out of the hospital for treatment.
The Franciscans initially gave them $1,000 toward the trip, but then refused Ms. Bond’s further requests for reimbursements for lodging expenses for her and Nathan in New York. This is what pushed her over the edge, she said. Dozens of e-mail messages between Ms. Bond and church lawyers document the back-and-forth. Catherine A. Schroeder, the Franciscans’ lawyer, said Ms. Bond failed to provide proper receipts, an accusation that Ms. Bond denies.
The head of the province then was the Rev. Michael Perry, who was recently elected vicar general of the entire Order of Friars Minor. Reached at his office in Rome, Father Perry declined to speak on the record about the decisions he made, except to say, “Efforts were made not only to respect the law but to take into account the dignity and the rights and the care of the child.”

209,CASES; Rare Tumor Is Deceptive And Deadly,"''Do you have flushing?'' the gastroenterologist repeatedly asked my wife early last year. Days before, she had had a routine colonoscopy, and now the doctor was asking her if her face was turning bright red, and if she was sweating uncontrollably. Except for a few gastrointestinal problems over the years, Carol felt fine. But she wasn't. She had cancer.
Thinking she had an irritable bowel, the doctor had directed the probe a few inches into her small intestine. A small, one centimeter nodule -- a polyp, he figured -- was found and biopsied. It was not a polyp, but a rare carcinoid tumor.
Carcinoid tumors often take years to develop, so the disease is called ''cancer in slow motion.'' Dave Thomas, the founder of Wendy's hamburger chain, had a carcinoid tumor for 10 years until it metastasized into his liver and contributed to his death in January. (The cause was widely cited as liver cancer, with no mention of the carcinoid tumor.)
My wife, Carol, was very lucky. Her carcinoid tumor was found by accident, and it was just one centimeter in diameter. ''With carcinoid tumors that small, 'cure' is a fair word to use,'' said her physician, Dr. Anthony Heaney, who is setting up a carcinoid treatment center at Cedars-Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles.",2002-03-26 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,carcinoid syndrome

211,"At the End, Offering Not a Cure but Comfort","Still, as an aging population wrangles with how to gracefully face the certainty of death, the moral and economic questions presented by palliative care are unavoidable: How much do we want, and need, to know about the inevitable? Is the withholding of heroic treatment a blessing, a rationing of medical care or a step toward euthanasia?
A third of Medicare spending goes to patients with chronic illness in their last two years of life; the elderly, who receive much of this care, are a huge political constituency. Does calling on one more team of specialists at the end of a long and final hospital stay reduce this spending, or add another cost to already bloated medical bills?
Dr. O’Mahony and other palliative care specialists often talk about wanting to curb the excesses of the medical machine, about their disillusionment over seeing patients whose bodies and spirits had been broken by the treatment they had hoped would cure them. But their intention, in a year observing their intimate daily interactions with patients, was not to limit people’s choices or speed them toward death.
Rather, Dr. O’Mahony and his colleagues were more subtle, cunning and caring than their own words sometimes suggested.
An Escort for the Dying
They are tour guides on the road to death, the equivalent of the ferryman in Greek myth who accompanied people across the river Styx to the underworld. They argue that a frank acknowledgment of the inevitability of death allows patients to concentrate on improving the quality of their lives, rather than lengthening them, to put their affairs in order and to say goodbye before it is too late.
Dr. O’Mahony, 41, went to medical school in his native Dublin, straight out of high school. He intended to go into oncology. But during training at a prominent cancer hospital in New York, he changed his mind as he saw patients return to the hospital to die miserable deaths, hooked to tubes, machines and chemotherapy bags until the end.
“In Ireland, and I think most other places, it would be very much frowned upon,” he said.
Sandy-haired, a wiry marathon runner, Dr. O’Mahony is the sixth of eight children; his father is a university professor devoted to preserving Gaelic as a second language, and his mother a painter. When he was 3, his brother, who had cerebral palsy, died at age 4. His awareness of his parents’ helplessness, burnished through years of family conversations, helped steer him to palliative care, he said.",2009-08-20 01:59:28,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,carcinoid syndrome
212,"When Medicine Errs -- A special report.; At Roosevelt Hospital, 3 Deaths Lead to 3 Different Responses","In Mrs. Robins's case, Dr. Thys said, those precautions were not taken. After the woman was sedated and the breathing tube was inserted, her heart rate suddenly slowed, then quickened, then stopped. Attempts to resuscitate her were futile and she died in the operating room.
The hospital's internal report of the incident found ""the standard of care not met"" in this case. Those deceptively mild words are among the strongest used in the medical community for questionable treatment of a patient. Specifically, the report said, the likelihood of complications from the carcinoid tumor was not properly evaluated, and during the operation the patient was not treated with medication that might have reversed the effects.
Dr. Thys agreed that a mistake had been made. ""If a lesson is to be learned out of this,"" he said, ""it's that if another carcinoid patient ever has to come to the operating room, we will take every precaution.""
Even so, the anesthesiologist in the case, Dr. Eric Kincaid, was not disciplined or required to take continuing medical education courses. In addition, the incident was never reported to the Health Department. State law requires the reporting of any unexpected deaths, or deaths that may have resulted from hospital or doctor error. 'Death Was Not Unexpected'
Dr. Thys said this incident is different from the other two, because, although an error occurred, the patient's health was extremely poor and the error could therefore not be blamed for her death. ""We felt the death was not unexpected given the course of her illness,"" he said.
Dr. Kincaid declined to be interviewed for this article. The Department of Health disagreed with the hospital's evaluation of the seriousness of the case. Alerted to the incident while investigating the death of Mr. Sklar, the department has cited Roosevelt for failing to report Mrs. Robins's death. Peter Slocum, a spokesman for the department, said a full review of the case is under way.
According to Dr. Thys, Mrs. Robins's family was not told of the findings of the hospital's investigation. Nor, to his knowledge, were they told everything that happened in the operating room. Attempts by a reporter to locate her family were unsuccessful.
When her relatives were told she had died during the procedure, they were ""relieved,"" Dr. Thys said, because she was ""out of her pain.""",1992-11-12 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,carcinoid syndrome

214,Think Like a Doctor: A Terrible Stomachache,"He listened patiently, interrupting only occasionally to ask a question or two. In looking at the patient he could see how much she’d been affected by this pain. She was terribly thin. And the way her clothes fit suggested that she’d lost the weight recently.
When he examined the patient, she pointed to the spot where she felt her recurring pain. She could locate it easily — a few inches above her belly button and slightly to the right. The doctor gently placed his stethoscope over the spot, listening for what’s called a bruit, the noise blood makes when its flow is turbulent. There is an unusual disorder known as median arcuate ligament syndrome, in which one of the main arteries leading to the intestines is compressed against the diaphragm by this ligament, which connects the left and right sides of the diaphragm. The compression intermittently reduces blood flow, and that could make this kind of noise. But he heard nothing.
The patient’s husband pointed to a couple of other spots where he’d felt lumps or bumps. The doctor felt the spots. The first was her aorta, the vessel that carries blood from the heart to the rest of the body. The second, a little higher up and off to the side, was her backbone. That’s how thin she was.
Another Round of Testing
After the exam the doctor shared his thinking. A rare type of growth called a gastrointestinal stromal tumor, or GIST, was a possibility. A carcinoid tumor — also rare — could present with this type of intermittent pain. A more common possibility was Crohn’s disease. Though Crohn’s usually caused chronic diarrhea, it could also present with pain alone. To look for these conditions he would order a special type of CT scan, one that could give them a good look at the structure of the bowel wall, especially in the small intestines.
He also wanted to check the levels of certain vitamins — particularly those absorbed in the small intestine. She had been given a diagnosis of a vitamin B12 deficiency some years ago and he wanted to see if she had some difficulty absorbing other vitamins as well.
Normal Tests, but Still in Pain
When those studies were all normal, the doctor had to rethink her case. In two CT scans she’d had a lot of stool in the colon. Could this be a motility problem?
The doctor ordered a gastric transit study to see if there was some problem with her gut’s ability to move food forward through the system. And finally something was abnormal. The food slowed down just a little as it passed through her intestines. She had something known as gastroparesis. Most of the time the cause is never found. And often, it never goes away.",2016-10-06 14:00:06,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,carcinoid syndrome
215,Study Points to New Culprit in Heart Disease,"It was breakfast time and the people participating in a study of red meat and its consequences had hot, sizzling sirloin steaks plopped down in front of them. The researcher himself bought a George Foreman grill for the occasion, and the nurse assisting him did the cooking.
For the sake of science, these six men and women ate every last juicy bite of the 8-ounce steaks. Then they waited to have their blood drawn.
Dr. Stanley Hazen of the Cleveland Clinic, who led the study, and his colleagues had accumulated evidence for a surprising new explanation of why red meat may contribute to heart disease. And they were testing it with this early morning experiment.
The researchers had come to believe that what damaged hearts was not just the thick edge of fat on steaks, or the delectable marbling of their tender interiors. In fact, these scientists suspected that saturated fat and cholesterol made only a minor contribution to the increased amount of heart disease seen in red-meat eaters. The real culprit, they proposed, was a little-studied chemical that is burped out by bacteria in the intestines after people eat red meat. It is quickly converted by the liver into yet another little-studied chemical called TMAO that gets into the blood and increases the risk of heart disease.",2013-04-07 17:01:26,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,carcinoid heart disease
216,Linking Infection to Heart Disease,"''There's no evidence this bacteria does anything in humans like what we see in rabbits,'' Dr. Herzberg said. But, he added, ''I think we're showing a potential for these organisms to contribute to clotting events that may proceed to a heart attack.''
Clotting touches off most heart attacks and strokes by blocking arteries that feed the heart or brain. Even though most victims' arteries have already been narrowed by fatty deposits, the deposits alone are not usually enough to choke off the blood supply: the final blow is nearly always the formation of a clot.
The idea that dental infections can cause problems in other parts of the body is a very old theory that has bobbed in and out of favor throughout the history of medicine, Dr. Herzberg said. Studying the medical literature, he found that the Assyrians proposed it in the 7th century B.C., but that it was then forgotten until the 16th century. The idea faded again and resurfaced in the 18th century, when Dr. Benjamin Rush, a Pennsylvania doctor and signer of the Declaration of Independence, reported that arthritis went away in some people after they had infected teeth pulled out.
Doctors now pay serious attention to the possibility that bacteria from the mouth can cause an array of problems if they get into the bloodstream. The potential link to arthritis is being studied in some laboratories, Dr. Herzberg said. Pregnant women with gum disease have been found to have a substantially increased risk of giving birth prematurely. And people with certain heart problems or artificial joints are thought to be especially vulnerable to such bacteria, and are advised to take antibiotics whenever they have dental work that might cause bleeding, which opens the bloodstream to bacterial invasion.
In addition, since 1989, about a half dozen studies have found that people with periodontal disease have an increased risk of heart disease and stroke. The increase has ranged from 20 percent to a doubling or tripling of risk, said Dr. James Beck, an epidemiologist in the dental school at the University of North Carolina in Chapel Hill. Dr. Beck said the evidence did not prove cause and effect, but it did suggest that gum disease might increase the risk of cardiosvascular disease.
Recent studies have also suggested that other infections may play a role in cardiovascular disease. The bacterium Chlamydia pneumoniae, which infects the lungs, is thought to damage arteries as well, and a common virus, cytomegalovirus, has also been blamed for causing arterial blockages in people who have had bypass surgery or heart transplants.
Dr. Thomas Quinn, an infectious disease researcher at Johns Hopkins University, said most researchers had come to believe that inflammation, a response of the immune system brought on by infection, plays an important role in cardiovascular disease, perhaps by injuring blood vessels and predisposing them to the buildup of fatty deposits. Antibiotics that attack Chlamydia pneumoniae are being tested to see if they can help prevent heart attacks in high-risk patients, he said.",1998-02-17 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,carcinoid heart disease
217,Heart Disease Risk May Be Tied to Y Chromosome,"The researchers also do not yet know which individual genes in the cluster are responsible for the increased risk, nor do they know why the genes have this effect. And the study, said its lead author, Dr. Maciej Tomaszewski of the University of Leicester, does not completely explain the male disadvantage in heart disease.
But Virginia M. Miller, a heart disease researcher at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., who wrote an editorial that accompanied the paper, said in an interview that the work “puts a whole different perspective on some risk factors for heart disease in men.”
Everyone knows men who did all the wrong things — ignored their cholesterol levels, smoked — and yet were spared heart disease, Dr. Miller said. And everyone knows men who were careful about their diet, controlled their cholesterol levels and blood pressure and did not smoke, yet died young from heart attacks.
The message of the new study, Dr. Miller said, was that for some of those unlucky men, “yes indeed, they did have inheritable factors that independently caused death.” And when a screening test is developed to find those Y chromosome gene clusters and researchers have a better understanding of how they act, it may be possible to protect some of them from having heart attacks.
Dr. Tomaszewski and his colleagues found the Y chromosome gene association by looking at men in two large British heart disease studies. He said he and his colleagues were surprised by the magnitude of increase in risk for men with one of two genetic clusters.",2012-02-09 04:37:33,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,carcinoid heart disease
218,Glucosamine Tied to Heart Benefits,"Glucosamine, the dietary supplement widely used for arthritic pain, may reduce the risk for cardiovascular disease, researchers report.
Scientists looked at 466,039 British men and women, ages 40 to 69, who were free of cardiovascular disease at the start of the study. Participants completed detailed health questionnaires that included information on the use of dietary supplements. Nearly 90,000 of them, or 19 percent, reported regular use of glucosamine. The study, in BMJ, tracked the participants’ health for an average of seven years.
Compared with those who did not use the supplement, glucosamine users had an 18 percent lower risk of coronary heart disease, and a 15 percent lower risk of any cardiovascular event. There was a weak association with a lowered risk for stroke.

219,Coffee Drinking Tied to Lower Risk of Heart Failure,"A large analysis looked at hundreds of factors that may influence the risk of heart failure and found one dietary factor in particular that was associated with a lower risk: drinking coffee.
Heart failure, sometimes called congestive heart failure, occurs when the heart muscle becomes weakened and can no longer pump blood efficiently. It can be caused by high blood pressure, heart valve disease, heart attack, diabetes and other diseases and conditions.
The analysis included extensive, decades-long data from three large health studies with 21,361 participants, and used a method called machine learning that uses computers to find meaningful patterns in large amounts of data.
“Usually, researchers pick things they suspect would be risk factors for heart failure — smoking, for example — and then look at smokers versus nonsmokers,” said the senior author, Dr. David P. Kao, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Colorado. “But machine learning identifies variables that are predictive of either increased or decreased risk, but that you haven’t necessarily thought of.”",2021-02-19 00:12:09,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,carcinoid heart disease
220,"Meat Increases Heart Risks, Latest Study Concludes","One of the authors of the new study, Linda Van Horn, is a member of the advisory panel that is currently helping the federal government update its influential Dietary Guidelines for Americans, which have long recommended that people limit their intake of red and processed meat. Dr. Van Horn is a member of two advisory panel subcommittees, including one that is drafting recommendations on dietary fats and seafood.
In an interview, Dr. Van Horn said that the new study relied on some of the highest quality data available. She said the findings reinforce recommendations that people should prioritize foods such as fresh fruits and vegetables, whole grains, legumes, fish, nuts and seeds and limit their intake of foods such as red and processed meats, refined grains, fried foods and sugar-sweetened beverages.
“When you eat a diet that is rich in processed and refined foods, it collectively contributes to increased risk of disease and denies you the benefits of the fiber, vitamins, minerals and plant-based proteins that contribute to health,” said Dr. Van Horn, division chief of nutrition in the department of preventive medicine at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine.
The conclusions of the new study contrast with those of the report last fall in Annals, which found that reductions in red and processed meat intake resulted in fewer deaths from cancer and heart disease but concluded that the evidence was weak because much of the data came from observational studies that cannot show cause and effect. The authors said that any increased risk was too minimal to warrant telling people that they should cut back on meat.
Critics complained that the research was flawed. They argued that the authors evaluated the evidence against meat using a tool that was designed for clinical drug trials, not dietary studies. The lead author of the report came under fire for failing to disclose conflicts of interest, including taking money from a food industry group to publish a similar paper in the Annals three years earlier that used the same methods to discredit widespread guidelines urging people to eat less sugar. In December, the Annals issued a correction on the meat paper acknowledging the lead author’s undisclosed conflicts.",2020-02-03 16:00:04,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,carcinoid heart disease
221,CHILDHOOD; A Heart Disease That Slumbers,"Slightly more than 60 percent of victims are boys. The illness -- first diagnosed in the United States in the 1980's -- does not necessarily run in families, but there have been community outbreaks, the latest about four years ago in the Denver area.
So far, only in Japan -- where there are an estimated 6,000 cases a year -- have researchers been able to follow patients longer term. Among those now in their 30's who suffered damage to their blood vessels as a result of the syndrome, there appears to be a greater risk of hardening of the arteries.
''We suspect that those who have structural change in the arteries may be at risk,'' said Dr. Robert P. Sundel, program director of the rheumatology department at Children's Hospital Boston.
The problem is that doctors are not sure how to measure that risk. When blood vessels are altered in shape and quality, they can heal but will not function normally, Dr. Sundel said. Unseen irregularities or turbulence affects the vessels and weakens them. Dr. Sundel compared it to tearing the elastic smooth surface of a silk stocking.
''It does not stretch and expand normally,'' he said. ''It is more likely to get pulled and torn.''
The risk of death during the initial infection has fallen in recent years. Treatment with intravenous gamma globulin, which is blood plasma extract that contains antibodies, has helped to lower the mortality rate to less than 0.1 percent from about 2 percent. Some centers are also experimenting with using steroids in addition to gamma globulin.
Affected children fall into roughly three categories: those with large aneurysms; those with medium-size aneurysms; and those with no noticeable anatomical change. Without treatment with gamma globulin, those with larger aneurysms (8 millimeters or more) have a one-third chance of a heart attack in the year after infection.
The largest group of patients have no visible aneurysms, but their blood vessels do not dilate and restrict normally, Dr. Sundel said. Because the blood is flowing turbulently through the affected area, blood cells clump and raise the possibility of clotting which, depending on the area of the body, could lead to ruptures and heart attacks.",2004-06-21 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,carcinoid heart disease
222,Experts Want More Studies of Diet’s Role for the Heart,"“Nutrition research is where heart attack research was,” Dr. Lauer said. Patients in those days were advised to stay in bed for four to five weeks and take lidocaine to normalize their hearts’ rhythms and nitroglycerin to open blood vessels.
But it turned out that treatment actually hastened death. It took years to find the answers, but eventually, Dr. Lauer said, dozens if not hundreds of large clinical trials radically transformed heart attack treatment.
But when it comes to diet and heart disease, doctors — and patients — have been going on hunches.
The new study could be a start in changing all that, heart researchers said.
It involved 7,447 people in Spain, half of whom were randomly assigned to follow a Mediterranean diet and the rest to follow the sort of standard low-fat diet that cardiologists often prescribe. It was ended early after less than five years because those on the Mediterranean diet had 30 percent fewer heart attacks, strokes and deaths from heart disease compared with people in the control group, who ate more or less the same way that they always had. They had been instructed to follow a low-fat diet but had not been able to comply.
Dr. Ramón Estruch of the University of Barcelona, the lead author of the study, said that although some had thought people would never allow their diets to be decided by a figurative toss of a coin, it was not hard to get people to switch to a Mediterranean diet.
“They wanted to eat the way their grandfathers ate,” he said. Most study participants actually thought they were already eating that way.

Then, like an accordion, the python’s organs return to normal size in just a few days. Metabolism slows. Then the snake can fast for months, even a year, without losing muscle mass or showing any ill effects, ready to ambush new prey.

225,Appendicitis? Antibiotics May Be All You Need,"Image
Antibiotics may be a good option for many cases of appendicitis.
Several randomized trials have shown that treating appendicitis with antibiotics rather than surgery may be safe and effective, but the long-term effects of avoiding an appendectomy have been unclear.
Now in a new study, published in JAMA, researchers did a five-year follow-up of 256 patients who had been randomized in a large trial to receive antibiotics instead of surgery for uncomplicated appendicitis — in which the appendix is not ruptured, there is a low white blood count and there is no fecal blockage.
About 60 percent of the patients never needed an appendectomy. Of the 100 who did eventually need surgery, 70 percent had it in the first year, and none of the 100 had any adverse outcomes related to the delay in performing the operation. The decision to perform surgery was left to the discretion of the treating surgeon, which could have resulted in more operations than necessary.
“If I have a CT scan, and I can see that the appendicitis is uncomplicated,” said the lead author, Dr. Paulina Salminen, a surgeon at the University of Turku in Finland, “I would discuss with the patient the possible results of antibiotic treatment alone or surgery. Then we would make a joint, unbiased decision about what would be best.”",2018-09-25 16:23:17,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,appendicitis
226,Diagnosing Appendicitis Remains Complicated,"Let’s start with “Madeline.” In that classic children’s story by Ludwig Bemelmans, published in 1939, the little French girl of the title is awakened in the night by severe abdominal pain, and the doctor races to get her to the operating table.
Enchanted by the book when I was Madeline’s age (and later when I read it to my own children), I memorized the hospital’s phone number as if I might someday need it: “And he dialed: DANton-ten-six  / ‘Nurse,’ he said, ‘it’s an appendix!’ ”
And then ambulance, surgery, waking up from anesthesia, 10 days in the hospital, and discharge (to the old house that was covered with vines). Oh, and a scar on her stomach.
When I was a resident, that was still the story, though hospital stays were generally shorter. Diagnosis was largely by medical history and physical exam; half a century after Madeline’s experience, and a full century after appendicitis was first described and named (in 1886, by Reginald Heber Fitz, a Harvard pathologist), there was still no way to know for sure whether a child’s abdominal pain was caused by an inflamed appendix.",2010-08-09 20:16:45,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,appendicitis

229,"Antibiotics Are Effective in Appendicitis, Study Says","In reviewing the medical literature, he found that much of the original research was done by a pathologist, Dr. Reginald H. Fitz, who in 1886 investigated why people die from pelvic infections.
Dr. Fitz looked at autopsy reports and found many patients whose appendices had been inflamed. That led him to conclude that the appendix may become injured, then infected, then gangrenous; finally, he theorized, a lethal infection spreads through the pelvis.
The way to prevent this dire chain of events, Dr. Fitz decided, was to remove the appendix. But more recent research has shown that the infected appendix does not become “gangrenous” and — as even Dr. Fitz noticed — some patients simply get better on their own.
In the 1950s, soon after antibiotics were discovered, some doctors reported success using them to treat patients with appendicitis. But, Dr. Livingston wrote in his editorial, “So powerful is the perceived benefit of appendectomy for appendicitis that surgical treatment for appendicitis remains unquestioned, with seemingly little interest in studying the problem.”
Dr. Livingston also found that most appendices that perforate have already done so by the time the patient shows up at an emergency room. Those that have not perforated when the patient seeks medical help almost never do so.
People with so-called uncomplicated appendicitis, he concluded, seem to have a different disease — one that can be treated with antibiotics.
“The reason we take the appendix out and do it as an emergency is the belief, dating back to 1886, that the appendix will eventually become gangrenous and cause a pelvic abscess,” Dr. Livingston said.",2015-06-16 15:41:46,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,appendicitis
230,The Case Against Appendectomies,"Even though about two patients in five treated with antibiotics later required an operation, the advantages of a nonsurgical approach for those who were spared a recurrence of appendicitis include avoiding potential complications from anesthesia and surgery and a much longer recovery.
Still, you may want to know, why keep this organ, given that 7 percent of us will develop appendicitis during our lifetimes? The answer, my friends, is that the appendix is turning out to contain biologically useful tissue that may help prevent nasty gastrointestinal ills.
As long ago as 1913, a British surgeon pointed out that the appendix is a mass of lymphoid tissue that most likely protects against harmful infections. “The vermiform appendix of man is not solely a vestigial structure,” Dr. Edred M. Corner wrote in The British Medical Journal. “On the contrary, it is a specialized part of the alimentary canal, Nature having made use of a disappearing structure and endowed it with a secondary function by giving it lymphoid tissue to protect the body against the micro-organisms in the ileo-caecal region.”
Now, a century later, researchers have provided evidence in support of Dr. Corner, contradicting longstanding medical dogma to remove the appendix, not only when it’s infected, but whenever surgery for some other reason renders it accessible. Sixteen years ago, when I was about to be operated on for a strangulated intestine, I was asked if I wanted my appendix removed at the same time.
My response was “Hell no! It might be useful.” Though I could cite no biological evidence at the time, I suspected evolution didn’t produce and preserve the appendix for no reason. As it turns out, Heather F. Smith, an evolutionary biologist, and colleagues at Midwestern University in Glendale, Ariz., have found convincing evidence that “the appendix had apparently evolved independently more than 30 times in the course of mammalian evolution, suggesting that it provided some kind of adaptive advantage,” she told me.
“The appendix, with its high concentration of lymphoid tissue, stimulates and supports the immune system, especially when pathogens invade the gastrointestinal tract,” she explained. Furthermore, she suggested, we could do a lot better to preserve the health-promoting potential of this tissue.
Dr. Smith pointed out that, although great apes, several other primates and rodents have an appendix, only humans get appendicitis, a condition that predominantly afflicts people in industrialized nations who consume a Westernized high-carbohydrate, low-fiber diet that can result in calcified carbohydrate particles becoming trapped in the opening to the appendix.",2018-11-19 10:00:01,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,appendicitis
231,New X-Ray Method Helps Find Appendicitis,"The technique, which Dr. Rao's team calls FACT, for focused appendix CT, involves inserting a dye through a tube in the rectum to show the appendix, which does not consistently appear on other X-ray and ultrasound tests, Dr. Rao's team reported.
Appendicitis, or inflammation of the appendix, can be difficult to diagnose, particularly in elderly people. For example, Pope John Paul II underwent an appendectomy in October after he experienced three episodes of abdominal pain earlier in the year.
Suspected appendicitis is usually diagnosed at the bedside, with the aid of clinical symptoms and standard blood and urine tests. Standard X-rays of the abdomen are often performed, but in only about 10 percent of cases are they able to pinpoint a diagnosis of appendicitis. CT scans and ultrasound tests have generally been used only in equivocal cases. Confirmation of appendicitis generally comes only at surgery.
In the study, the CT scans led to a presumptive diagnosis of appendicitis in 59 of the 100 participants, 6 to 84 years old, and the diagnosis was confirmed at surgery in 56. Two patients did not have an inflamed appendix and the diagnosis was uncertain in a third who did not undergo an appendectomy.
Of the 41 participants who had CT scan X-rays that did not show appendicitis, a different diagnosis was made in 33. Usually it was inflammation of lymph nodes, a condition known as mesenteric adenitis. Surgery was needed in only one of these patients. None of the participants who had negative CT scans had appendicitis in a three-month period after the procedure.",1996-12-04 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,appendicitis
232,"A Night in the Hospital, From Both Ends of the Stethoscope","Just as the first coronavirus reports were emerging from China in late 2019, the medical world was observing the 20th anniversary of “To Err is Human,” the seminal report from the Institute of Medicine that opened our eyes to the extent of medical error. The news media jumped on the popular aviation metaphor, that the number of Americans dying each year as a result of medical error was the equivalent of a jumbo jet crashing every day. Those numbers remain difficult to accurately quantitate, but we know that they are not small.
The conversation has now been broadened to include all preventable harms to patients, even ones that are not errors per se. As I set about writing a book on medical error, I wanted to see both sides of the story. I drew upon my own experiences as a physician but also interviewed patients and families to get the view from the other side. But I soon realized that the distinction between those two “sides” was rather fluid.
Midway through writing the book, my teenage daughter experienced a stomachache. My kids know that fevers, colds, coughs and sprained ankles do not get my pulse up, and that “if you’re not bleeding out or in cardiac arrest” they should seek medical sympathy from their computer programmer father. They often accuse me of ignoring their medical complaints altogether, but as a primary care doctor I know that most aches and pains of daily life get better on their own and are best left unobsessed about.
But this time I became suspicious of my daughter’s inability to find a comfortable position and so pulled out my stethoscope. When I heard complete silence instead of gurgling bowel sounds, I shuttled us straight to my hospital’s E.R. My correct diagnosis of appendicitis modestly redeemed me in my daughter’s eyes, though she was mortified that I chatted it up with colleagues.",2021-01-05 10:00:10,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,appendicitis
233,The Riddle of the Appendix,"I recently spent a few days recovering from having my appendix removed. As I padded around my house in my pajamas, I pondered that dear departed bit of my gut.
I only became aware of my appendix when it flared with infection. Soon I was lying in an ambulance, with a paramedic poking at my abdomen. ""Oh yeah,"" he said, and went back to filling out paperwork.
The nurses and doctors at the hospital agreed, and a CT scan confirmed the diagnosis. Not long after, I was unconscious, and a surgeon was cutting open my side to get my appendix out before it ruptured. My life might be hanging in the balance, but the procedure had the routine efficiency of a teeth cleaning.
That's what comes with practice. When I got back home, I began doing some research and found that each year, more than 250,000 Americans had appendectomies. The more I thought about that figure, the more absurd it seemed. Why should an organ fail in so many healthy people? What makes it more puzzling is that no one ever needs an appendix transplant. Appendix-free, I can expect a normal life.",2005-08-09 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,appendicitis
234,"Kenan Varin, 8, Hopes for Relief From Hirschsprung’s Disease","Each morning, Kenan Varin walks to the toilet and empties his colostomy bag, which stores all the waste his diseased bowel cannot evacuate. He attaches a new one to the skin around a hole in his stomach, with the help of an adhesive strip that is surprisingly expensive. Before he leaves the house he will pack an extra bag.
He will replace the bag twice more before the day is over, and because it fits under his clothes, he can feel it expand with his waste again and again, a queasy sensation he has had to endure three times a day for the last seven months.
His condition is the result of Hirschsprung’s disease, an anomaly in the large intestine, which can be remedied only with another risky operation; the first three he underwent, in his native Haiti and then in the United States, resulted in complications from which he has yet to recover. Only his best friend and his mother know he goes through life with a colostomy bag under his clothes  he has managed to keep his condition secret from his girlfriend, Jahnay, which is easier than it sounds, as they have only yet held hands.
Kenan Varin is 8 years old.
“My mom says because I have my colostomy I can’t do tricks with my bike,” Kenan said one afternoon in lightly Creole-accented English. Beside him sat his mother, Christine Desgages, 44, who, six years ago, brought her son first to Vermont, then the Bronx in search of a surgical solution to the congenital birth defect that left him without vital nerve cells in the last part of his large intestine. Though the diseased section was removed during the first surgery, performed when he was 1 ½, his bowel narrowed dangerously, causing waste to back up into his intestine and requiring another operation.

235,"Lucrative Drug, Danger Signals and the F.D.A.","The company said it removed the drug from the market because physicians continued to prescribe it inappropriately despite repeated attempts by the company to warn them against that.
Jason Brodsky, an F.D.A. spokesman, said that the Propulsid case had been unique because doctors insisted on having access to the drug, despite its side effects, and because its label was unusually confusing. Although the F.D.A. has the power to declare a drug mislabeled and order it off the market, it has done so only once in the last 30 years. Short of that, any label change sought by the agency has to be negotiated with manufacturers, a process that sometimes takes more than a year.
Testifying before Congress in March, Dr. Sandra Kweder, the F.D.A.'s deputy director of the office of new drugs, bemoaned such delays and said having the power to mandate label changes ""would be very helpful."" Even without that power from Congress, the F.D.A. has recently made moves to disclose concerns about drugs' adverse effects before label negotiations with drug makers are complete.
The government and Johnson & Johnson negotiated for five years before the company pulled Propulsid. By then, the federal government had reports of 80 heart-related deaths and 341 injuries among patients taking Propulsid.
First Signs of Trouble
The first signs of trouble emerged soon after Propulsid was approved in 1993 for the treatment of nighttime heartburn in adults. By January 1995, the F.D.A. received reports of 18 Propulsid patients who had developed serious heart arrhythmias; one patient, an infant, had died. At a private meeting that month, agency officials told Johnson & Johnson executives that the drug was causing life-threatening arrhythmias, according to F.D.A. minutes of the meeting.
Company executives insisted that such problems occurred only in patients who took Propulsid with other drugs or who had heart problems. The company sent two letters to doctors and added warnings to the drug's label listing drugs that should not be used with Propulsid.
But by July 1996, regulators had reports of 57 Propulsid patients, including seven children, who had developed serious arrhythmias or other heart problems. In August 1997, after the company told the F.D.A. that two more children taking the drug had died, a top agency official wrote to the company that Propulsid's growing number of cardiac problems among infants and children ""suggests that pediatric patients may be at greater risk for them.""",2005-06-10 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,hirschsprung disease
236,Managing Outcomes Helps a Children’s Hospital Climb in Renown,"By carefully charting measures like the range of joint motion achieved by juvenile arthritis patients, to cite another example, the hospital is trying to identify the most effective therapies and adopt them as standard treatments.
And demonstrating the value of dealing with the practical aspects of a patient’s medical condition, Cincinnati Children’s can point to data showing that 95 percent of children with severe intestinal abnormalities who complete its bowel-management program are able to leave wearing normal underwear.
One recent beneficiary is Matthew Swan, an 8-year-old from just outside Boise with a rare congenital disorder affecting his large intestine. After treatment at Cincinnati Children’s, Matthew for the first time in his life is able to attend school full time.
Identifying specialties where it can excel, and pursuing them with a business-minded operational rigor, helped the nonprofit hospital take its place among the nation’s best pediatric centers. It now vies for patients with the likes of Children’s Hospital Boston, affiliated with Harvard, or the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.
Lacking the prestige of other well-known pediatric centers, Cincinnati Children’s had to learn to compete on something else, said Dr. Charles Homer, the chief executive of the nonprofit National Initiative for Children’s Healthcare Quality. “The something else is quality.”

The hospital’s national emergence has been led by James M. Anderson, a former corporate lawyer who ran an industrial valve maker before becoming the hospital’s chief executive in 1996. The goal, he said, is to make “the experience you have in Cincinnati Children’s to be so much better an experience you want to come here.”",2007-09-15 04:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,hirschsprung disease
237,Senators Ask Drug Giant to Explain Grants to Doctors,"The Senate Finance Committee yesterday began an inquiry into whether Johnson & Johnson used educational grants to promote the pediatric use of its former heartburn medication, Propulsid, even as internal company concerns mounted during the 1990's about the drug's safety in some children.
The inquiry follows a June 10 article in The New York Times describing how, despite growing evidence linking the drug to heart problems and deaths, the company helped pay for a physician's book recommending Propulsid's use in children and gave grants to pediatric gastroenterology organizations that favored such use.
Johnson & Johnson withdrew Propulsid in 2000 after reports of 80 heart-related deaths and 341 injuries among patients taking the medication.
In a letter yesterday to the company's chief executive, William C. Weldon, Senators Charles E. Grassley and Max Baucus cited the article and requested information and documents disclosing who received the grants, the amount of those grants and their purpose.",2005-07-06 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,hirschsprung disease
238,Drug Makers Scrutinized Over Grants,"Food and Drug Administration regulations have long allowed drug companies to give educational grants to individuals or groups that discuss or promote off-label uses. But in recent years, federal prosecutors have been investigating whether these activities have strayed beyond educational purposes and violated antikickback statutes or resulted in the government's spending money in its Medicare and Medicaid health programs for prescriptions that were not warranted.
In one example cited in the committee's letter, Johnson & Johnson in 1999 provided an ""educational"" grant to pay for an alumni reception at the annual meeting of a medical specialty society.
That grant was provided at the request of a physician who had previously received grant money for research and educational activities related to Propulsid, a Johnson & Johnson drug that was withdrawn in 2000 after it was found to cause potentially fatal heart arrhythmias. Although Propulsid was approved only to treat severe heartburn in adults, it ended up being widely prescribed for off-label use by children.
The committee's letter seeks information beyond what Johnson & Johnson has already provided investigators. Jeffrey Leebaw, a company spokesman, declined to comment, beyond saying, ""We are in receipt of the letter and will cooperate with the committee's request for additional information.""
Ken Johnson, a senior vice president for the industry's main trade group, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America, said drug makers' decisions about awarding educational grants were up to the individual companies. ""We do, however, offer comprehensive voluntary guidelines to our member companies that are designed to help keep marketing practices ethical,"" he said.
Some companies have said that they have revamped their grant-making procedures recently, taking the power to bestow grants out of the hands of marketing executives and giving it instead to executives in the companies' medical divisions.
But the committee found that these changes had not been universally adopted.
""It appears that many manufacturers' sales and/or marketing personnel still have a role in originating or evaluating grant requests,"" the committee's letter to Johnson & Johnson said.",2006-01-11 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,hirschsprung disease
239,A Place to Go When a Child Really Refuses Food,"With the baby, as with the 11-year-old, Dr. Manikam and his colleagues used “deconditioning,” a behavioral psychology technique that aims to extinguish a conditioned response. Therapists began by playing the sound of the vacuum cleaner, then altering it slightly until the baby’s window of acceptance grew larger. This took six weeks.
They took a similar approach with the brain-injured girl who would only eat off the floor: Therapists hid in the house and observed her while she ate alone, then played with her on the floor when her parents were not around, to “neutralize the battle of wills.” The therapists became “positive agents,” new figures in her life, and very slowly they added food to the play. Four months later, she was eating at a table.
Years ago, many of these children would have received diagnoses like colic or failure to thrive. The notion of a feeding disorder is a relatively new one, and only 15 percent of families coming to St. Mary’s are reimbursed by insurance for the cost of treatment, said Burton Grebin, the hospital’s president and chief executive.
Dr. Grebin is working to convince the State Health Department that the demand for these services merits Medicaid reimbursement: Dr. Manikam estimates that one in four children has some kind of feeding disorder, and that severe problems occur in 3 percent to 10 percent of the population, a percentage that continues to rise as neonatal medicine improves.
It is clear, at any rate, that families are looking for help: The wait for treatment at the Center for Pediatric Feeding Disorders is 16 to 18 months. Marilyn Villalona was so excited when her son, John, 12, got a spot there that she quit her job as a receptionist in a dentist’s office to accompany him full time. She was watching on a recent morning while he sat with a therapist, gazing down into a bowl of steak and mashed potatoes.
For 10 years, Ms. Villalona has been preparing liquid food for her son. He was born with Hirschsprung’s disease, a disorder of the colon, which required the insertion of a colostomy bag from infancy to age 2. Although he was physically able to eat from that age onward, every attempt met with gagging, coughing and anxiety, which was particularly upsetting because he also suffers from congenital heart disease. Throughout his childhood, he would join the family around the table at restaurants, watching as his two younger sisters ate, Ms. Villalona said.
This is John’s second month as a patient at the center, and his mother has watched, mesmerized, as the therapist nudged him toward solid food, doling out rewards (in John’s case, the reward is Pokemon or Yu-Gi-Oh trading cards) in exchange for an agreed number of bites. He comes for three 20-minute sessions a day, with each session’s result entered in a spreadsheet. Ms. Villalona was sitting in an observation room, watching over a video link, when he ate his first mouthful of mashed potatoes.",2007-08-23 04:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,hirschsprung disease
240,RELATIONSHIPS; WHEN A CHILD IS IN HOSPITAL,"Contemporary parents are certainly no longer just purveyors of candy and kisses. ''The most fundamental role they play is to provide continuity between the home and hospital,'' said Dr. Michael Katz, director of pediatric service at Babies Hospital, a division of Presbyterian Hospital. ''It is important to insure that acutely ill children, especially toddlers, don't perceive the hospital as a place of abandonment. Even 6-to 8-year-olds may think 'They're getting rid of me,' so we definitely encourage parents to stay over.''
Susan Wojtasik is director of Bellevue Hospital's child life department, which was established to provide emotional support for children and their families during hospital stays and clinic visits. In her view, ''If a child has never been separated from his or her parents before, that in itself may be the most significant part of hospitalization. For the very young child, surgery or medical treatment may not be as distressing as separation.''
But, Mrs. Wojtasik observed, hospitalization temporarily realigns the parents' relationship to other people in their children's eyes. ''In day-to-day life,'' she said, ''the parent is the child's ultimate authority. But when the child is in a vulnerable position, the parent becomes dependent on others, and that change in the power structure gets through to the child.''
Concurrently, she said, medical personnel are also redefining their relationships to parents. ''In the best of all worlds, hospital staff members ought to see themselves as support for parents in continuing their parental roles,'' Mrs. Wojtasik said. ''But some of them may feel threatened by the things parents do. They may feel they have lost some of the joy and gratification of caring for children.''
Physicians, nurses and administrators who deal with sick children agreed that the main role of the hospitalized child's parent is to continue being a parent, performing such normal tasks as bathing and feeding, but also to be a partner in the medical team.",1982-03-22 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,hirschsprung disease
241,"SUNDAY MONEY: SPENDING; Over the Counter, Yes, but Out of the Insurance Plan","Drug companies also have a stake in offering medicine directly to consumers, said Eric J. Mack, assistant professor of pharmaceutics at the Massachusetts College of Pharmacy and Health Sciences in Boston. If a drug is losing patent protection, he said, it makes sense for the drug company to sell it over the counter and start a huge marketing campaign, in the hope that consumers will continue to buy a particular drug even if similar drugs soon enter the market. And with no prescription needed, he said, more buyers may appear.
Charles Ganley, director of the F.D.A.'s over-the-counter drug division, says that the only factors the agency considers in deciding whether to allow a drug to be sold over the counter are ''safety and effectiveness.''
''A lot of this is based on changes in society,'' he said. ''There is more emphasis, for whatever reason, on self-care.''
Consumers, of course, want to pay less for over-the-counter medications. In September, the Internal Revenue Service announced that individuals could use pretax dollars, through flexible savings accounts, to pay for such drugs. But vitamins and nutritional supplements are not eligible, and the cost of over-the-counter drugs cannot be deducted on a tax return.
Dr. Kathleen W. Wilson, an internal medicine specialist at the Ochsner Clinic in New Orleans, said her patients had various ways of coping. ''They do not buy lifestyle medicine such as Claritin unless they can afford it or their symptoms really bother them,'' she said. ''They adapt to the high price of reflux drugs by using them intermittently on the worst days and using the lower-priced drugs on the other days.''
And as many insurance plans raise the co-payments for prescription drugs, some consumers find that switching to over-the-counter medications -- even if they are not covered by insurance -- can save money, especially if they shop around.
Shev Rush, a publicist from Palm Springs, Calif., was taking prescription drugs for his allergies and acid reflux disease. Two months ago, when he switched insurance plans, his co-payment for Flonase, an allergy drug, rose to $65 from $15 for a month's supply. His co-payment for Protonix for acid reflux went to $90 from $30.",2004-07-04 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,hirschsprung disease

It turns out that this longstanding bit of medical wisdom was based on virtually no scientific evidence, just guesswork, and unless you have already developed inflamed or infected diverticula, your diet need not be so restricted, most experts say.
You no longer have to seed tomatoes, you can enjoy strawberries, raspberries and blueberries, and you can even eat nuts as long as you chew them thoroughly.
Now, just what is this condition and what should be done to prevent it and its complications?
People living in industrialized countries have paid some hefty health-related prices for their relatively affluent lives, like high rates of heart disease, cancer, obesity, diabetes and osteoporosis. But there is one extremely common health problem linked to affluence that few are aware of, unless they suddenly become seriously ill.

246,Can I Ever Recover From Diverticulitis?,"Q. Can I ever recover from acute diverticulitis?
A. The answer depends on the severity of your diverticulitis.
The mildest end of the spectrum of diverticular disease is diverticulosis. Diverticulosis is simply a collection of outpouchings, or diverticula, in the wall of the colon. Aside from being an occasional source of blood in the stool, diverticulosis usually does not cause symptoms.
Diverticulitis — the suffix “itis” indicates inflammation — typically occurs when a diverticulum becomes blocked by a piece of hard stool, called a fecalith. This localized blockage leads to bacterial overgrowth, followed by inflammation, infection and abscess formation. At the most severe end of the spectrum, the abscess can rupture and stool may enter the abdominal cavity, which may result in sepsis, a dangerous blood infection.
But severe disease is not the norm. Most people with diverticulosis do not progress to diverticulitis. Only 10 percent to 20 percent go on to have pain or bleeding.",2019-01-04 10:00:01,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,diverticula

The President's physical examination was done at the Naval Medical Center, National Region, on May 18, 1984. During the prior two weeks some laboratory studies were done, and the results are included in this report.
Capt. W. W. Karney, who supervised the examination and did a portion of the examination, stated that, ''Mr. Reagan is a mentally alert, robust man who appears younger than his stated age.'' Auditory acuity of the right ear was diminished. There was contraction of one of the flexor tendons of the left hand (Dupuytrens). The remainder of the general physical examination was normal.
Ophthalmological examination confirms the myopia for which he wears contact lenses.
An extensive urologic examination done on April 1, 1982, was within normal range. A limited examination performed on May 18, 1984, confirmed the previous studies. Polyp Was Found

250,New Treatments Help Remove Spider Veins,"But generally these products do not meet with approval from physicians.
“No studies have been done that have proved their efficacy, or at least not that I know of,” said Dr. Michael Traub, a naturopathic physician in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii. “You can’t just put something on the surface of the skin and expect a spider vein to go away, ” Dr. Traub said.
Some topicals, such as Auriderm Clearing Gel, contain a form of vitamin K called vitamin K oxide. “Vitamin K oxide helps rebuild vascular walls and repair damage surrounding them, reducing the appearance of spider veins,” said Elliott Milstein, president of Biopelle, the Michigan-based company that distributes the product. He added that Auriderm is often used as an adjunctive therapy “prior to sclerotherapy to reduce spider veins, or after laser treatment to clean up what the laser may have missed.”
For some, a $50 cream may seem preferable to spending hundreds of dollars for sclerotherapy or laser treatments.
Sclerotherapy involves injecting each spider vein with a solution that irritates the vein’s lining and causes its walls to collapse. Until the 1940s, the chemical compounds used in these injections  such as iron and mercury solutions  had dubious side effects. But, now, sclerotherapy is performed with saline-based compounds and even more recently, a foam that prevents leakage to surrounding areas of the tissue.
“The gold standard of spider vein treatment is sclerotherapy,” said Dr. Brian Zelickson, associate professor of dermatology at the University of Minnesota and founder of Zel Skin and Laser Specialists, a skin-care center in Edina, Minn., near Minneapolis. “The needles can be guided by ultrasound,” he said.

251,Why Was This Teenager Bleeding So Excessively?,"The other possible source was her lungs, and to look there they would need a CT scan of the girl’s chest. She had been in the hospital for nearly a week at this point. She’d had many tests, many needle sticks and no answers; she was worried and frustrated. Another test — during which she would be uncomfortable and cold and would have one more needle stick (for the contrast dye) — seemed more than she could bear. Even as she was transported to the scanner, she wept, asking her mother if the test could be canceled. “I can’t do it,” she wailed. But she did, breathing when instructed and holding her breath as much as she could between sobs.
The Cause of the Bleeding
Dr. Tej Phatak was both a pediatrician and the radiologist helping to manage her care. Through the control-room window, he saw the girl’s tear-streaked face disappear into the scanner, then watched the pictures click into place on his monitor. Suddenly he saw an irregularly shaped splash of brightness in the bottom of her right lung, in a place that should have been mostly dark. It looked like a tangle of vessels. He recognized it immediately. It was a pulmonary arteriovenous malformation, or PAVM, an abnormal connection between a pulmonary vein and an artery. Veins are thin-walled structures that carry slow-moving blood and expand or contract depending on how much blood is flowing at that moment. Arteries are thick, muscular vessels built to hold up under the fast-moving, high-pressure blood that comes out of the heart with each beat. The structure he saw was too big to be a vein and too misshapen to be an artery. It had to be a PAVM — and they are prone to tear, which can result in dangerous bleeding.
Phatak rapped sharply on the window to get the attention of the patient and her mother. “I know what you have!” he shouted. He hurried into the scanner room to explain what he saw and what it meant. What she needed, he told them, was a procedure to close off this vessel so that it would never bleed again.
The patient was sent to Yale-New Haven Hospital for the procedure. The large PAVM in the lower part of her right lung was closed up with loops of fine wire, about the width of a human hair. Blood would clot around the coils of wire, essentially sealing off the vessel for good.
A Solution and Another Problem
For most patients, a single diagnosis is all that is needed to answer the question “What’s wrong with me?” Not so in this case. These abnormal pulmonary vessels indicate a diagnosis that, in turn, often signals the presence of yet another rarity — an inherited disease known as hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia, or H.H.T. This disorder, usually passed from parent to child, causes abnormal blood vessels to form, most frequently in the stomach, lungs, nose, liver or brain. In addition, most patients (though not this one) with H.H.T. develop red freckle-size spots, known as telangiectasias, tiny malformed vessels located throughout the body. These abnormal vessels can cause serious bleeding, as in this case, as well as infections or even strokes. Patients with H.H.T. tend to have frequent, even daily, nose bleeds — as this girl did — and can experience blood loss through the stomach or other parts of the gastrointestinal tract, in their lungs or even in their brains.
A genetic test confirmed that she had one of the mutations that cause H.H.T. Because neither of her parents have the disorder, it’s a mutation that occurred in this girl’s genome just after conception. It was important to confirm the diagnosis, because if she had children, they would have a 50-50 chance of inheriting the mutation and the disease.
Mysteries Remain
It’s still unclear what made the girl’s heart develop that abnormal, potentially deadly rhythm. It’s not part of the usual manifestations of H.H.T. And her cardiologist wonders if she has a heart problem in addition to her H.H.T. She and her mother hypothesize that the PAVM and bleeding somehow triggered the arrhythmia. And it’s true that she’s had no arrhythmias in the six years since her PAVM was treated.
The girl is reminded of her disease by her near-daily nose bleeds — a common problem among those with H.H.T. But she hasn’t let them slow her down. She graduated from college two years ago and has been hard at work in her career ever since.",2018-03-13 09:00:16,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,telangiectasia
252,GENE FOR RARE DISEASE TIED TO BREAST CANCER,"Even though the work does not actually prove that the gene causes breast cancer, ''the association is statistically very strong,'' said Dr. Michael Swift, who directed the research.
He said the research suggested that ''7.5 percent of all breast cancer could be attributable to the action of this gene.''
His research, which was conducted at the University of North Carolina, was to be published in the May 21 issue of The New England Journal of Medicine.
''Breast cancer shows a great degree of running in families,'' said Dr. John Mulvihill of the National Cancer Institute. ''We would like to have a greater understanding of why. This could be a partial explanation.''
Although many men and women are thought to have the gene, there is no way to know who they are unless two of them marry and produce a child with the disease. Then doctors can assume that both parents have one copy of the gene.",1987-05-21 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,telangiectasia
253,"Parents Take Charge, Putting Gene Hunt Onto the Fast Track","Joseph Yerushalmi, a lawyer from New York whose 13-year-old son has the disease and who has been a director of the foundation since 1984, studied the basic research the group had supported and found that ""it was so vague, so basic,"" he said.
Mr. Yerushalmi consulted with scientists and concluded that the foundation should redirect its efforts, putting nearly all of its money into a search for the gene. He easily persuaded others on the board.
""We basically said, 'We are going to do this,' "" said Gerald Adler, a lawyer from New York who is president of the foundation. The group sent out letters to five leading geneticists, asking if the foundation could pay them to find the gene. Some did not reply, and others declined. Dr. Gusella alone said he was interested. So far, Mr. Adler said, the group has paid him about $400,000 a year. But he added that the foundation was committed to paying whatever it costs to get the gene.
Dr. Gusella's interest was sparked because one researcher in his lab had a relative with the disease and another had been a longtime recipient of small basic-research grants from the foundation. He said he would not have applied to the National Institutes of Health for a grant to find the gene.
Three years ago, Dr. Gusella reported that he had found markers -- identifiable segments of DNA -- that flanked the dysautonomia gene. Such markers vary from family to family, so DNA samples from a relative with the disease are needed as a reference for genetic testing. Couples who had a family member with the disease and who had DNA samples from that person could use prenatal diagnosis to see if a fetus had dysautonomia.
Mr. Adler, whose daughter died of the disease before she was 6, said he and his wife had wanted another child but had been very nervous about taking a risk of having another baby with the disease. When Dr. Gusella found the flanking markers, the Adlers' daughter was dead, and she was the only family member with dysautonomia. So Mr. and Mrs. Adler thought at first that they could not use the new test.
Then, Mr. Adler said, his wife, Vivian, woke in the middle of the night with a flash of inspiration. They had saved their daughter's hairbrushes, and she realized that the cells on the brushes might enable scientists to analyze the child's DNA.",1996-07-16 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,telangiectasia
254,Study Tying Gene to Cancer Risk Draws Fire,"A report in the current issue of The New England Journal of Medicine says that as many as 1 percent of women carry a gene that can greatly increase their risk of breast cancer if they are exposed to even low levels of X-rays. But experts on cancer and radiation are challenging the report, saying the data do not support such a provocative and disturbing statement.
The author of the report, Dr. Michael Swift of the University of North Carolina, studied 19 women with a single copy of a gene that causes ataxia telangiectasia, a disease affecting coordination, when a person inherits two copies.
It is generally accepted that people with a single copy of the defective gene have a lowered ability to repair breaks and cracks in DNA, the genetic material, that occur routinely as the body is bombarded with naturally occurring radiation. Radiation Exposures Compared
After an earlier study, Dr. Swift concluded that an increased incidence of breast cancer in the United States was linked to this gene. In his new study, he looked at the health records of 1,599 relatives of people with ataxia telangiectasia and 821 of their spouses.",1991-12-27 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,telangiectasia
255,Treating Disease With A Famous Face,"An expectant silence followed. Ms. Carter, who as a superheroine wore golden wristlets that magically deflected bullets, coughed and sallied forth.
''I mean, if Bob Dole can talk about his penis. . . .'' she added, sounding helpful.
She was right, of course. In America, there is scarcely any disorder, no matter how lowly, that has not had its image enhanced thanks to a celebrity spokesman. Anemia and its cures have been championed by Danny Glover, rheumatoid arthritis by Kathleen Turner and bladder control by Debbie Reynolds. Rare syndromes have found spokesmen in Ben Affleck (ataxia-telangiectasia) and Rob Lowe (febrile neutropenia).
The public does not always understand that many of these celebrity champions are paid players in the marketing strategies of pharmaceutical companies, who pull the strings to make them dance before the public and news media. Ms. Carter is on the payroll of the Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, which markets an I.B.S. drug. Mr. Dole, of course, was hired by the maker of Viagra.
While attaching a celebrity to a disease can motivate sufferers to seek treatment or lead to more research financing, the arrangements are ethically complicated, medical experts say. Last summer, CNN and ABC adopted polices to assure that viewers are told of celebrities' ties to drug companies after stars like Ms. Turner and Lauren Bacall spoke of their ailments on news programs without mentioning they were paid.
Despite the networks' bearing down, the practice continues and the relationship between stars and sickness has evolved further, affecting both the public's perceptions of treatment and financing for research. Dr. Arthur Caplan, the director of the Center for Bioethics at the University of Pennsylvania, said the relationship between celebrities and disease has become so cozy that he is now supervising a study of the impact on drug sales and public health.",2002-12-15 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,telangiectasia
256,Scientists Designed a Drug for Just One Patient. Her Name Is Mila.,"There are over 7,000 rare diseases, and over 90 percent have no F.D.A.-approved treatment, according to Rachel Sher, vice president of regulatory and government affairs at the National Organization for Rare Disorders.
Tens of thousands of patients could be in Mila’s situation in the United States alone. But there are nowhere near enough researchers to make custom drugs for all who might want them.
And even if there were, who would pay? Not the federal government, not drug companies and not insurers, said Dr. Steven Joffe, professor of medical ethics and health policy at the University of Pennsylvania.
“Unfortunately, that leaves it to families,” he added. “It feels awfully uncomfortable, but that is the reality.”
That means custom drugs would be an option only for the very wealthy, those with the skills to raise large sums of money, or those who gain the support of foundations.
Mila’s drug development was mostly paid for by the foundation run by her mother, but she and Dr. Yu declined to say how much was spent.
The idea of custom drugs also leads the F.D.A. into uncharted territory. In an editorial published with Dr. Yu’s paper, Dr. Janet Woodcock, director of the F.D.A.’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research, raised tough questions:
What type of evidence is needed before exposing a human to a new drug? Even in rapidly progressing, fatal illnesses, precipitating severe complications or death is not acceptable, so what is the minimum assurance of safety that is needed?
She also asked how a custom drug’s efficacy might be evaluated, and how regulators should weigh the urgency of the patient’s situation and the number of patients who could ultimately be treated. None of those questions have an easy answer.",2019-10-09 21:57:13,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,telangiectasia
257,Map of Yeast Genes Promises Clues to Diseases of Humans,"To learn what a gene does in yeast cells, molecular biologists simply delete it and watch to see how the cell functions without it. Such an experiment takes ""a couple of days"" in yeast but can take two years in mice, Dr. Broach said.
Already, Dr. Broach has found that a human cancer gene, called ras, is also in yeast cells and makes them lose control of their growth. In addition, Dr. Collins said, scientists have used yeast genes to figure out the function of a human gene, ataxia telangiectasia, that when mutated leads to a susceptibility to cancer and to extreme sensitivity to radiation damage. They have also used yeast to discover the function of a human gene that when mutated causes neurofibromatosis, a disorder that leads to the growth of tumors along nerves.
The huge effort to find the DNA sequence of a yeast cell began in 1989, when Dr. Andre Goffeau, a biochemist at the Catholic University of Louvain-la-Neuve in Belgium, organized it among European laboratories. Later, laboratories in the United States and Japan joined in. Each laboratory was assigned to determine the sequence of the nucleotides, or DNA building blocks, of a segment of genetic material.
As the DNA sequences were discovered, the investigators put their results into a publicly accessible data bank. Now, the sequence of all 12 million nucleotides, encompassing the 6,000 yeast genes, has been deposited.
Researchers said that the previous sequencing of bacteria paled in significance to the sequencing of yeast. They explain that bacteria are much more primitive than yeasts.
Bacteria, Dr. Collins said, are separated from yeasts by several hundred million years of evolution. They lack nuclei and do not move through orderly phases of growth, rest and division, like those of higher organisms. ""All of the complex functions of nucleated cells are not going to be represented in bacteria,"" he said.
In addition to helping researchers understand the function of human genes, the discovery of the complete yeast DNA sequence is of broader importance, said Dr. Maynard V. Olson of the University of Washington.",1996-04-25 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,telangiectasia

And it clears up your skin.”
Mr. Lim tried a three-day oral regimen of arnica before walking the red carpet, and was pleased with the results. “I did feel like my skin glowed afterwards,” he said.
Available in pellets, topical gels, creams and even massage oil, arnica is the latest of many herbal remedies to invigorate, if not intoxicate, the fashion crowd. Linda Fargo, the fashion director of Bergdorf Goodman, counts the pellet form as one of her fashion week survival must-haves, and the stylist Isabel Dupré has long been a fan.

To my surprise, I find pleasure in the sorting, as it is one of the few moments when I can pretend I have some control over the bizarre war raging in my colon.
When I learned 11 months ago at age 29 that I had a chronic illness, I understood that my life was going to change. I knew I would stop eating certain foods, limit stress and think more strategically about when to have children. What I didn’t anticipate was the loss of control over my life that I thought I had, until the gastroenterologist uttered the words “ulcerative colitis.”
He explained that for reasons unknown, my immune system was ravaging the walls of my large intestine, mistakenly trying to fight off a nonexistent foreign invader. Short of removing the colon, he said, there was no cure  leaving me to contend with unpredictable bouts of abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, fatigue, weight loss, dehydration and night sweats. Forever.
Before my illness, I didn’t realize I had been operating on the assumption that there was an equation to explain how things played out. It was almost like physics.

267,Crohn’s Disease and Colitis Are Linked to Mutant Gene,"There are treatments for Crohn’s, but no cure. Anti-inflammatory drugs, immune system suppressants, antibiotics and surgery are all used, with varying degrees of success. Most treatments have side effects that can range from trivial to debilitating.
Various causes for Crohn’s have been proposed, including diet, infections with specific bacteria, possible environmental factors and immune system disorders. But most scientists believe that an immune response to normally beneficial intestinal bacteria in genetically susceptible people is the cause. Understanding this susceptibility may allow the development of treatments that will specifically target the key immune response pathways.
In this study, researchers compared the genomes of Crohn’s patients of European descent, both Jewish and non-Jewish, to those of healthy controls of the same ancestries. More than 1,900 subjects were involved in the analysis. The report appears online in the Oct. 26 issue of Science Express.
The researchers examined more than 300,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs (pronounced “snips”), the variations that occur when a nucleotide, a molecular subunit of DNA, is altered. They found that the frequency of variations in the gene for a receptor of a protein called interleukin-23, or IL-23, was significantly different in people with Crohn’s disease compared with healthy people. After finding the difference in Crohn’s patients, they found it in ulcerative colitis sufferers as well. This genetic variation leads to a susceptibility to the inflammation that characterizes I.B.D.
The IL-23 receptor gene is not the only one thought to be associated with I.B.D., but it seems an especially good candidate. “The IL-23 immune pathway was already implicated in I.B.D., psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis,” said Dr. Richard H.

269,"For Bowel Diseases, A New Drug Approach","Each can cause serious side effects. Sulfasalazine, which is related to both aspirin and the sulfa drugs, is only marginally effective when given as the sole drug in patients with active colitis. Once such an attack has been controlled, patients take it to reduce the chances of a further one.
Sulfasalazine has two components: sulfapyridine and 5-ASA (aminosalicylic acid). Sulfasalazine pills work because most of the drug remains intact until it reaches the large bowel. There, harmless bacteria cleave it into the two components. In recent years, scientists have shown that 5-ASA is far more active as an anti-inflammatory agent and that sulfapyridine led to most of the side effects.
Drug companies have made several experimental preparations of 5-ASA on the theory that 5-ASA alone should work while producing few side effects. In practice, however, 5-ASA alone is not effective because it is rapidly absorbed from the small bowel through which it must pass to reach the colon. Thus not enough 5-ASA may reach the diseased areas of the large bowel. Special Coatings
So chemists have coated 5-ASA, and the closely related 4-ASA, with various substances and prepared it in other ways designed to deliver it to the colon. At least six such preparations are marketed or are being tested in the United States, said Dr. Stephen B. Hanauer of the University of Chicago.
One drug, Rowasa, is marketed as an enema by Reid-Rowell of Marietta, Ga., and it is also being tested as coated pills. Others, which are treated to be dissolved according to time or the degree of acidity, include: Pentasa, made by Marion Laboratories of Kansas City, Mo.; Asacol, made by Norwich Eaton of Norwich, N.Y.; Claversal, made by Smith Kline & French of Philadelphia, and 4-ASA, made by Reed & Carnrick of Piscataway, N.J.
Dipentum, or olsalazine, which is made by Pharmacia, and which was recently tested by a team at the Mount Sinai Medical Center, consists of two molecules of 5-ASA linked by a nitrogen bond. The structure allows it to pass unchanged through the small bowel to reach the colon, where bacteria cleave the drug to release the two molecules of 5-ASA. Doctors believe that 5-ASA acts directly on the damaged bowel, blocking key biochemical steps in the inflammatory process. Reactions to Drugs
Up to one-third of those who take sulfasalazine develop nausea, vomiting and allergic reactions.

270,SCIENCE WATCH; Irritable Bowel Syndrome,"Gastroenterologists in Cambridge, England, believe they have discovered that sensitivity to certain foods is a frequent cause of irritable bowel syndrome, a disorder usually attributed to psychological factors.
Irritable bowel syndrome, with its symptoms of abdominal pain, gas, and diarrhea, is an extremely common problem in which no organic abnormalities are apparent in the bowel.
Currently used treatments, which usually bring limited relief, include bran, bulk laxatives, antispasmodic drugs and tranquilizers.
Using strict dietary controls among 21 patients, the researchers showed that 14 patients developed symptoms of abdominal pain and diarrhea only after eating specific foods, with some patients affected by more than one food. The foods implicated were wheat (9 patients), corn (5), dairy products (4), coffee (4), tea (3), and citrus fruits (2). When the implicated foods were eliminated from the patients' diets, their symptoms disappeared.",1982-11-30 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,irritable bowel syndrome
271,Symptoms: Irritable Bowel Syndrome and Action by the Brain,"Women who suffer from irritable bowel syndrome may respond to pain signals differently from other women, leaving them more vulnerable to the intestinal discomfort that characterizes the disease.
That is the finding of researchers who exposed women with and without the syndrome to mildly painful stimuli and then watched how their brains responded using a functional M.R.I. machine. The study appeared Jan. 9 in The Journal of Neuroscience.
The researchers focused on the brain’s ability to tamp down its response to pain if it knows that it is coming and that it will not be too severe. (It also does this if the pain will bring about a benefit, like the removal of a splinter.)
When women without irritable bowel syndrome were about to be given the pain stimuli after a warning, their M.R.I. showed their brains stepping down the brain response. But the women with the condition appeared unable to do so.",2008-01-22 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,irritable bowel syndrome
272,New Evidence Citesv Overactive Nerves For Irritable Bowel,"The new finding, ''lets the patient off the hook,'' Dr. Schuster said. ''Doctors very frequently would, in a sense, blame the patient for the illness. Patients have been sent to psychologists or psychiatrists and many have come away with the idea that the problem is in their head.'' An increasing number of researchers are now convinced that ''the problem is in the gut,'' he added.
Patients with irritable bowel syndrome have abnormalities of a nervous system that serves their stomach and intestines, experts have found. These nerve abnormalities may be inborn, they say. 'They Hyperrespond'
''These people are built differently,'' Dr. Mendeloff said; they have jumpy enteric nervous systems, the independent nerves that serve the intestine. ''Whatever you do, they hyperrespond.''
The intestinal nerves control muscles that move food through the digestive system. When the nerves overreact or react inappropriately, food can be pushed through too quickly or too slowly, causing diarrhea or constipation, or the intestines can go into spasms, causing abdominal pain.
For example, Dr. Schuster and Dr. Whitehead found that people with the syndrome are extraordinarily sensitive to bloating. When the researchers inflated a balloon in the intestines of irritable bowel patients, their intestines went into spasms, while those of normal volunteers did not. Dr. Drossman said that irritable bowel patients react with spasms and symptoms to ''anything that activates the bowel, such as certain foods or stress.''
Dr. Gershon explained that the uniqueness of the intestinal nervous system offers some hope for finding specific drugs to treat the syndrome. The bowel, he said, ''is the only organ with its own nervous system that can function independently of the brain and spinal cord.'' Ordinarily, the brain helps control the bowel's nervous system, which is why stress, for example, can exacerbate the syndrome. But the bowel's nerve cells are sufficiently distinct that they can function on their own.
''Many of us are trying to find out what the role of these intestinal neurons is,'' Dr. Gershon said. He and others are discovering that there are receptors for chemical signals in the bowel that are unique. Drugs that act on those receptors could help treat the syndrome without affecting the rest of the body. But he Dr. Gershon said that although the drugs ''have a lot of potential right now, I don't have a drug in my pocket that will cure irritable bowel syndrome.''",1988-02-02 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,irritable bowel syndrome
273,Irritable Bowel Syndrome Drug Succeeds in Trial,"An experimental drug can reduce abdominal pain and increase bowel movements in people with irritable bowel syndrome, a condition that affects millions of Americans, the drug’s developer said Monday.
The developer, Ironwood Pharmaceuticals, said the drug, linaclotide, met all the goals in the first late-stage trial testing it as a treatment for the type of irritable bowel syndrome accompanied by constipation. If the drug succeeds in a second Phase 3 trial, with results expected by the end of the year, Ironwood plans to file for regulatory approval next year.
As many as 20 percent of American adults have some symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome, according to the National Institutes of Health. The condition is poorly understood and somewhat vaguely defined, so estimates are not very precise. About one-third of the cases involve constipation, another third diarrhea and the rest both constipation and diarrhea, according to Dr. William D. Chey, an expert at the University of Michigan.
Laxatives can relieve the constipation but often do not help with the pain, said Dr. Chey, who is a consultant to Ironwood. Some drugs that treat the pain, including opiates, can make the constipation worse, he said.",2010-09-14 00:55:20,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,irritable bowel syndrome
274,Let the Mind Help Tame an Irritable Bowel,"If you’ve ever had butterflies in your stomach or an attack of nerves that sent you racing for the bathroom, you already know that the intestinal tract has a mind of its own. The millions who suffer from irritable bowel syndrome, or I.B.S., perhaps know it best.
I.B.S., with its symptoms of bloating, abdominal pain, flatulence, diarrhea or constipation or an alternating cycle of the two, can seriously impair the ability to work and enjoy leisure activities. Up to 15 percent of the population is affected, though only half seek medical help.
The gut and brain are intimately connected, with more nerve cells in the intestines than in the spinal cord. The gut has been called the body’s second brain, containing 95 percent of the body’s neurotransmitter serotonin and direct nerve connections to the brain.
So it is no surprise that this common disorder of intestinal function has a strong mind-body connection. This does not mean I.B.S. is a psychosomatic condition caused by emotions, but rather that emotional upsets can aggravate symptoms in someone with a hyper-reactive bowel.",2008-09-01 17:48:36,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,irritable bowel syndrome

In a study of youngsters aged 8 to 17, peppermint oil capsules helped relieve IBS, a collection of gastrointestinal symptoms including bloating, severe abdominal pain, and cycles of constipation and diarrhea that do not fit into known disease categories. While some believe that the cause may be stress-related or due to psychological problems, that theory is controversial.
``Peppermint oil should be considered for the treatment of moderate levels of pain in children with IBS,'' Dr. Robert M. Kline, of the University of Missouri-Columbia, and colleagues write in the January issue of the Journal of Pediatrics.

277,PERSONAL HEALTH; A Common Syndrome Seldom Discussed,"How People Cope
In addition to emotional distress, the symptoms of the syndrome can be made worse by certain habits, like eating big or irregular meals and fatty or spicy foods, as well as by specific foods. Although food sensitivities vary, problems commonly come from chocolate, caffeinated and carbonated beverages, dairy products containing lactose, foods sweetened with sorbitol or mannitol, gas-producing vegetables like cabbage, beans and broccoli and fruits like grapes and raisins, cherries and cantaloupe.
Diets rich in fiber help control diarrhea and constipation. But there is a catch: many high-fiber foods increase intestinal gas and can cause more cramping. So go slowly when trying to increase dietary fiber to give your system a chance to adjust. And if high-fiber foods don't do the trick, you might try taking a fiber supplement like psyllium (Metamucil, for example), which may be better tolerated.
If diarrhea is a problem, avoid fatty foods; they stimulate the bowel more than any other food. If you are lactose-intolerant, choose lactose-reduced dairy products (there are lactose-free versions of milk, cottage cheese and ice cream), low-fat hard cheeses and yogurt with active cultures.
Check the labels on dietetic foods and sugar-free candy and gum. Pass up those with sorbitol or mannitol, which can cause diarrhea. Eat small regular meals and don't rush them. Sit down, relax and enjoy them. Avoid chewing gum, talking while eating and eating too quickly; all cause you to swallow air and increase intestinal gas.
Keep a food-and-symptom diary to determine which foods bother you most and try to avoid them. If you think you are sensitive to something, don't eat it for two weeks, then gradually reintroduce it to see if your symptoms get worse. Note, too, that tobacco, alcohol, caffeine and spicy foods are common irritants that may cause a bad reaction. Certain medications, like antacids containing magnesium, may also cause problems for people with diarrhea. Keep track of them as well.
As for nonfood remedies, perhaps the most important is regular exercise to help normalize bowel function. Exercise is also a great stress reliever. Other stress-reducing activities include meditation, sports and hobbies. Cognitive behavioral therapy, hypnotherapy or traditional psychotherapy can help people whose symptoms are aggravated by stress.
Do not take laxatives for constipation; they can permanently impair gut motility. A fiber supplement, which acts as a bulking agent, is far preferable. Dr. Camilleri of the Mayo Clinic suggests an ''osmotic'' laxative like milk of magnesia or lactulose or a stool softener. Whichever you use, be sure to drink plenty of water -- more than two quarts a day.",2000-08-08 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,irritable bowel syndrome
278,U.S. Agency May Allow the Selling of Diarrhea Drug Linked to Deaths,"Lotronex will be the first drug considered by a new food and drug agency group, the Subcommittee on Drug Safety and Risk Management, which was created in December to provide expert advice on drugs like Lotronex that pose especially complex risk-benefit questions. Lotronex was one of 11 drugs taken off the market because of adverse effects since 1997.
The session today will be a joint meeting of the new subcommittee and the food and drug agency's Gastrointestinal Drug Advisory Committee. The maker of Lotronex, GlaxoSmithKline , will present new data on the drug and a plan to market it with new safeguards. Officials will also hear presentations from the food and drug agency's scientists and from patients and advocacy groups for and against allowing the drug to be sold again.
After the presentations, the two food and drug agency groups will vote on whether the manufacturer's new marketing plan should be accepted. Their findings will then be presented to the full Food and Drug Administration, which usually follows the advice of its advisory panels.
The problem with Lotronex is that it causes an increased risk of two potentially serious conditions: severe constipation and ischemic colitis, in which circulation to the bowel is cut off. Both conditions can resolve on their own once the drug is stopped, but in some cases they can require major surgery to remove part of the intestine. Both can be fatal.
Under the company's proposed ""risk management plan,"" Lotronex would be recommended only for women for whom other treatments had failed to control diarrhea caused by irritable bowel syndrome. Its starting dose would be cut in half, to 1 milligram a day, and the pill bottles would have information pamphlets attached. Doctors would have to request ""prescribing kits"" that would be delivered by company representatives who would discuss the drug.",2002-04-23 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,irritable bowel syndrome

280,A Colonoscopy Alternative Comes Home,"The Task Force is updating its guidelines for colon cancer screening and this year will likely recommend lowering the age at which it should begin, to 45. But the recommendations on the upper end will remain unchanged: Based on strong evidence, adults up to age 75 should be screened regularly.
Beyond that age, the disadvantages begin to mount. The Task Force says the benefit of screening 76- to 85-year-olds is small, and that the decision should be an individual one, reached in consultation with a doctor.
Colon cancer develops slowly, explained Dr. James Goodwin, a geriatrician and researcher at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston. Patients at older ages, who typically contend with several other diseases, may not live long enough to benefit. “You cause more harm than good,” Dr. Goodwin said.
The advice to stop screening isn’t always popular with patients. “People don’t like to hear about not living very long,” he said. But with colonoscopy, he noted, “you go through an unpleasant experience — or an unpleasant experience followed by an unpleasant diagnosis and unpleasant treatment — for something that, if you’d never known about it, wouldn’t cause you harm.”
Even if a test eventually finds colon cancer, surgery plus chemotherapy, the standard treatment, could itself endanger a frail older person. “I would be heavily biased against anyone getting a screening, of any sort, over age 80,” Dr. Goodwin said.
Although Americans still rely mostly on colonoscopy, his research has shown that for many older people, that test is overused, either because of the patients’ ages or because they are tested too frequently.
Yet screening is simultaneously underused. In 2018, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, only about 70 percent of adults were up-to-date on colorectal cancer testing. About one-fifth of those 65 to 75 had not been screened as recommended. Among those 50 to 65, where lack of Medicare or other insurance probably contributed, only about 63 percent were appropriately screened.",2021-01-11 18:40:14,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,colonic polyps

A new study, published in Cancer Prevention Research, included 42,486 men and women participating in two large continuing health surveys. Over the past several decades, the participants had periodically reported information on health and diet, including reports of gingivitis and tooth loss.
The researchers reviewed pathology reports from colonoscopies, documenting the incidence of two types of intestinal lesions that are precursors of colon cancer: serrated polyps and conventional adenomas. Removal of these lesions reduces colon cancer risk substantially.
Compared with people with no history of periodontal disease, those who had gum disease had a 17 percent increased relative risk of having a serrated polyp and an 11 percent increased risk of a conventional adenoma. The scientists also found that the loss of four or more teeth was associated with a 20 percent increased risk for having a serrated polyp.

282,CASES; Screening For Cancer: A Downside,"Spiral C.T. scanning of the lungs epitomizes the dilemma that plagues modern cancer screening. Through Pap testing and screening for colonic polyps, doctors can successfully prevent cervical and colon cancers. These situations underscore the value of early detection, which has long been the gospel of cancer control.
But in the case of other screening tests, like prostate-specific antigen (P.S.A.) testing for prostate cancer and mammography for breast cancer, our ability to discover early-stage tumors or other suspicious lesions is of less clear value.
In some instances, we are clearly discovering slow-growing cancers that will never actually kill the patient or rapidly-growing cancers that have already spread and are thus not ''early'' at all.
Doctors are wary about relying on anecdotes like that of Mrs. S., noting that ''the case does not make the rule.'' So it is especially important to conduct clinical trials to see if tests like spiral C.T. scans actually do save lives. Fortunately, studies are under way.
Yet, in another sense, the individual case is all important. Given that we may never have definitive proof of the value of spiral C.T. scanning, as is the case with P.S.A. testing or mammography, the decision to be screened will still come down to individual patients' weighing the pros and cons.
Should a patient dare to decline a scan that might discover an early, curable cancer? Should a patient risk the possibility of major surgery for a ''cancer'' that turns out to be benign? In such circumstances, stories like that of Mrs. S. become an essential way to educate other patients.
''I view it as a terrible experience,'' Mrs. S. recently told me. ''I have heard assurances that it was good to go in, that I was a lucky woman that there was no cancer. But the operation itself and the recovery period were tough. I guess I'll never know if it was necessary.''",2002-03-05 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,colonic polyps
283,HEALTH; 50% of Colon-Rectal Cancers Tied to Genetic Predisposition,"Two reports in tomorrow's issue of The New England Journal of Medicine describe the results of research linking the risk of developing the cancers to hereditary susceptibility and showing how certain much-studied cancer genes, oncogenes, may contribute to the development of the malignancies.
''Our study suggests that an underlying genetic susceptibility is present in the majority of persons'' with common colonic adenomatous polyps, benign growths in the intestine that often precede the development of cancer, said a report from University of Utah scientists. They added that their research supported the idea that both genetic and enviornmental factors, particularly dietary factors, were at work in causing those cancers. Too much fat and too little fiber in the diet are the factors most blamed for increasing a person's risk of colon cancer.
In the new study on prevalence of inherited predisposition, the medical scientists studied 670 people from 34 Utah families for whom there was much genealogical data. The families were chosen because of the occurrence of clusters of the cancers among blood relatives or the existence of at least one person who had an adenomatous polyp. The cancer experience of these people was compared with their spouses, because they were not blood relatives of the cancer patients but did share environment with them.
In another study published in the journal, scientists analyzed cancer tissues from a large number of colorectal cancers and adenomatous polyps. They found a succession of changes in the genes of cells as the tissues developed from the benign state as polyps to the cancerous state.
They said their evidence supported the concept that the cancers arose from the benign adenomas in a multistep process that included the action of one known oncogene and the failure to function of other genes that are normally responsible for suppressing the action of oncogenes and thus preventing the growth of cancers.
This study was done by a large group of scientists at the Johns Hopkins University, the State University of Leiden in the Netherlands and the University of Utah, led by Dr. Bert Vogelstein, and Dr. Stanley R. Hamilton of Johns Hopkins, Dr. Ray White of the University of Utah and Dr. Johannes L. Bos of the University of Leiden. Intensive Examinations in Study
All of the subjects in the Utah study were given detailed examinations, including use of optical devices to allow the doctor to view the inside of the lowest 24 inches of the bowel in searching for evidence of cancer or polyps. The study involved people 25 years old or older. The polyps and cancers seldom develop in younger patients, but increase in frequency with increasing age.",1988-09-01 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,colonic polyps
284,10 Questions You Need to Ask About Colonoscopy,"In the past, it was common for doctors to have patients take all the prescription the night before colonoscopy. This effectively cleaned out the fecal debris, but left the potential for a different problem that can develop when the time between the end of the preparation process and the start of the colonoscopy is prolonged. Thick mucus and intestinal secretions empty out of the small intestine during that interval and stick to the first parts of the colon. [See Figures]
This area, called the cecum and ascending colon, is an important area to see with the colonoscope because cancers commonly develop there. It’s also the most likely area for cancers to develop after a normal colonoscopy. Flat polyps are common in this area and can be hard to see even when bowel preparation is perfect.
The solution to this problem is split-dosing, though there are still doctors who don’t recommend it. One reason given for sticking with a single dose is that a patient scheduled to have a colonoscopy early in the morning would have to get up at 2 or 3 a.m. to take the second half of the laxatives. That doesn’t sound great, does it?
Image Delays between the end of the preparation process and the start of the colonoscopy can lead to thick mucous buildup (top) rather than a clean colon (bottom).
Look at it this way, though. You may undergo colonoscopy as infrequently as every 10 years. Therefore, you want the doctor to have the best possible shot at making sure your colon is normal. If you get up during the night for things like crying babies or sick family members, you can do it to avoid dying from colorectal cancer. So if you want that early morning appointment, let the doctor know you’re willing to get up and take the second half of the preparation.
Another reason that split-dosing is not used is that some anesthesiologists won’t let patients drink fluids after midnight, or for six to eight hours before they are sedated. They are worried that the patient may vomit and inhale fluids during the procedure. But this concern is misplaced. The evidence shows that when people are drinking only clear liquids, the same amount of liquid is left in the stomach whether you stop fluid intake two hours before the procedure or many hours before. Guidelines from the American Society of Anesthesiologists say that patients may take clear liquids by mouth until two hours prior to the time of sedation.
In addition to split-dosing, the next step is to get written preparation instructions from the endoscopy unit and to read through them at least a few days before the procedure is scheduled. This will allow you time to get all the materials you need and adjust your schedule if necessary for the day or evening before the procedure. Most bowel preparation regimens can cause some dehydration, so make plans to stay well hydrated. Sport drinks are better than water for this purpose. It’s good to start the hydration process before you start the laxatives and to continue to hydrate during the period of laxative ingestion and even after you complete the procedure. You’ll feel better and stronger if you stay hydrated.",2009-02-25 19:45:55,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,colonic polyps
285,Are Calcium Supplements Safe?,"Q. Are calcium supplements safe?
A. The short answer is probably yes.
Many people, especially women, take calcium supplements in the hope of building stronger bones, but whether calcium supplements prevent fractures remains uncertain. The United States Preventive Services Task Force advises postmenopausal women against taking 1,000 milligrams a day or less for preventing fractures and says not enough is known about the risks and benefits of taking higher doses.
What are the risks? Kidney stones are the most widely recognized risk of calcium supplements, but that risk depends on whether you are also taking vitamin D. The Women’s Health Initiative, a randomized placebo-controlled trial of calcium and vitamin D in more than 36,000 postmenopausal women, found a 17 percent increase in the incidence of kidney stones. A report prepared for the Preventive Services Task Force supported this conclusion, but noted that the risk disappeared when calcium was taken without vitamin D.
Studies have investigated other potential safety concerns, including an increased risk of death, cancer and heart disease. But data from the Women’s Health Initiative and another large study from the National Cancer Institute, both of which assessed calcium in combination with vitamin D, found that calcium supplements do not increase the risk of dying prematurely. These and other studies also found no increased risk of breast cancer, colorectal cancer, precancerous colonic polyps or cancer in general.
Calcium supplements probably do not increase the risk of heart disease. The best evidence, again, comes from the Women’s Health Initiative study of calcium and vitamin D. A Harvard review supports this conclusion, stating that “calcium intake, either from diet or from supplements, has little or no effect on cardiovascular disease risk.”",2018-10-12 09:00:02,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,colonic polyps
286,Colon and Rectal Cancers Rising in Young People,"“I still remember getting the phone call from the doctor who did the procedure, who was completely shocked, and said ‘I would never have guessed that a 22-year-old would have had cancer,’” said Ms. Freiborg, who was treated with surgery and chemotherapy and is now cancer-free.
Most colorectal cancers are considered a disease of aging, so any increase in young adults, especially when rates of the disease are on the wane in older people, is both baffling and worrisome, experts say.
Colorectal cancer rates have declined over all in recent years thanks to widespread use of screening tests like colonoscopies, which can detect precancerous polyps that can be removed before cancer develops. These screening tests have not been considered practical for a younger population, and while other less invasive screening tests exist, doctors are hoping improved methods that will be easier to administer will be developed.
Experts also attribute lowering cancer rates to changes in risk factors, particularly lifestyle changes like smoking cessation and healthier diets. Diets that include more fruits, vegetables and fiber and less red and processed meat are linked to lower colorectal cancer risk.
Obesity and sedentary lifestyles are also associated with colorectal cancer, as are heavy alcohol use and chronic conditions like inflammatory bowel disease and Type 2 diabetes, all of which are on the rise. But experts are not entirely convinced these are the only reasons colorectal cancer is increasing among young people. While rates of cancers tied to human papillomavirus, or HPV, have been rising in recent years, that virus causes mainly cancers of the cervix, anus or the back of the throat, and only a small number of cases of rectal cancer.
“The honest truth is nobody knows 100 percent why there is an increase,” said Dr. Mohamed E. Salem, an assistant professor at Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center at Georgetown University. He said that he is older than about 60 percent of his patients — and he is 42. “It’s hard to blame it on obesity alone. We suspect there is also something else going on.”
Dr. Jason A. Zell, an associate professor of oncology at the University of California, Irvine, who did a study in 2014 that found increasing rates of colorectal cancer among adults ages 20 to 39 in California, said the big challenge is how to shape health policy. “By now we know the rates are going up, it’s been reported several times,” Dr. Zell said. “Now the question is, what do we do?”",2017-02-28 15:00:04,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,colonic polyps
287,PERSONAL HEALTH; Calcium Takes Its Place as a Superstar of Nutrients,"*Chemical signaling within cells.
*Growth and maturation of lining cells throughout the body.
''It's not surprising that calcium plays so many roles,'' said Dr. Hector F. DeLuca, a biochemist at the University of Wisconsin who is an expert on vitamin D and calcium metabolism. ''Since all life originated in the sea in a bath containing calcium, we all developed systems that depend on it.''
Once animals emerged from the sea, leaving behind a steady supply of calcium, the body had to evolve a system for keeping calcium ''at sea level'' in the blood, Dr. DeLuca said. The result was the evolution of a calcium storage tank -- the bones -- for the body to draw on from minute to minute when blood levels of this essential mineral drop too low, as well as a mechanism to establish and replenish the body's calcium from outside sources -- the diet. This mechanism involves vitamin D. In its activated form as a hormone, vitamin D enables calcium to enter the blood through the intestinal wall and be incorporated into bone.
But if the body does not receive enough dietary calcium to maintain the needed blood level, parathyroid hormone leaps to the rescue. Its job is to signal the release of calcium from the bones to restore a normal blood level of this life-sustaining mineral. If the diet is chronically deficient in calcium (or vitamin D), as it is for as many as three-fourths of Americans, the bones gradually get weaker and weaker.
PMS and Bone Disease
A chronic deficiency or imbalance of calcium is what Dr. Susan Thys-Jacobs, a gynecologist at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center in New York, believes is largely responsible for the disruptive symptoms of PMS suffered by as many as 40 percent of women. In fact, Dr. Thys-Jacobs said, PMS may be a harbinger of osteoporosis, a warning that a woman is not getting enough calcium and, as a result, is constantly losing bone.
Buoyed by the promising results of a pilot study of calcium's ability to relieve premenstrual symptoms and menstrual pain, Dr. Thys-Jacobs and colleagues at 11 other medical centers enrolled nearly 500 women with debilitating PMS in a trial of calcium's ability to relieve their monthly discomfort. For two months, the women kept careful track of the occurrence and severity of 17 symptoms grouped under four categories: mood swings, bloating, food cravings and pain. Then they were randomly assigned to take either 1,200 milligrams of calcium daily (as calcium carbonate in Tums E-X) or a look-alike placebo. The women continued on their assigned regimens and evaluated their symptoms for the next three menstrual cycles.
By the third cycle, Dr. Thys-Jacobs and her collaborators reported in The American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, the overall severity of symptoms was reduced by 48 percent in the calcium group, compared with 30 percent in the placebo group. Improvement in the calcium group exceeded that of the placebo group in every category studied, both psychological and physical, and in 15 of the 17 symptoms evaluated. Most significantly, subjects in the calcium group noted a 54 percent reduction in aches and pains, while the placebo group had a 15 percent increase in pain symptoms. The study was financed by SmithKline Beecham, makers of Tums.
Dr. Thys-Jacobs concluded that women with PMS might have a form of ''functional hypocalcemia'' -- calcium levels in their blood and urine are normal, but only because parathyroid hormone levels are abnormally high and the hormone is continually extracting calcium from their bones to replenish the blood's supply. She suggested that all women with PMS be assessed for deficiencies of calcium and vitamin D, as indicated by their blood levels of parathyroid hormone and 25-hydroxy vitamin D. She pointed out that ''80 percent of a person's vitamin D is made in the skin when exposed to sunlight, but a lot of young women are now avoiding the sun and using sunscreens.''",1998-10-13 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,colonic polyps

Lynch, a colon cancer specialist at Creighton University School of Medicine in Omaha. ""I haven't done too well in treating patients with advanced colon cancer, and neither have any of my colleagues. The most important thing is to detect the cancer early, when it's at a curable stage, and that's what this work is all about.""
Cancer of the colon and rectum is the second biggest cancer killer in the United States, after lung cancer. The American Cancer Society estimates that 60,500 people will die of colorectal malignancy this year, and 157,500 people will contract the disease, with about half dying within five years.
So compulsive were the researchers about amassing evidence to support their claims that the work is being published in four parts. Dr. White and his colleagues wrote two of the papers, which appear today in the journal Cell, while Dr. Bert Vogelstein of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore and his collaborators at the Cancer Institute in Tokyo wrote the other two reports, presented in today's issue of the journal Science.
The new gene is called A.P.C., for adenomatous polyposis coli. That ungainly name underscores why researchers believe it is the first gene to be mutated in the lengthy and intricate evolution of colon cancer. Scientists strongly suspect that in its normal, healthy state, the gene helps block the unruly growth of colon cells. But they have found that the gene is profoundly defective in patients with a rare inherited syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis, in which people develop carpets of hundreds or thousands of tiny polyps along the colon lining, some of which progress to full cancer, often before the age of 30. About one in 5,000 people suffer from familial polyposis.
Without an inborn brake to help control untrammeled cell division, the colon cells proliferate first into polyps, and eventually into invasive tumors.",1991-08-09 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,adenomatous polyposis
290,Heriditary Link Studied As Colon Cancer Cause,"Scientists in Japan have found evidence that hereditary predisposition to cancer of the colon and rectum may be a result of a highly complex process involving loss of protective genes on any of several different chromosomes.
In a report published today in the journal Nature, the scientists suggested that the human complement of chromosomes may contain a ''limited'' number of genes whose loss or improper function may predispose a person to develop cancer or encourage its growth. Just how large that number may be is unknown. The new report showed evidence for genetic links to colorectal cancers on chromsomes 5, 6, 12, 15 and 22.
Last year scientists in England reported strong evidence linking some colorectal cancers to loss of protective genes on both copies of chromosome 5. Humans have 23 pairs of chromosomes that contain the estimated 50,000 to 100,000 genes that govern all hereditary traits. #60,000 Deaths a Year The group of cancers that arise in the colon and rectum are among the most common human malignancies. In the United States, 145,000 such colorectal cancers are detected every year and about 60,000 people die of them.
In recent years cancers have been linked to two kinds of genes; these are oncogenes, which help establish malignancy, and anti-oncogenes, which seem to protect against cancer. The disease develops only when both copies of such a protective gene are lost or rendered ineffective.",1988-01-21 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,adenomatous polyposis
291,Blood Test Devised to Warn Those Prone to Rare Cancer,"About one in 7,000 Americans suffer from the familial polyposis syndrome, and twice that many are thought to be at risk of having the disease. All told, scientists estimate, at least 50,000 people in the United States could immediately benefit from the new test. Researchers, however, emphasized that familial adenomatous polyposis accounted for only about 1 percent of all colon cancer cases and that the new test would not pick up other types of colon malignancies.
Recently scientists announced, to much fanfare, that they had isolated the gene for another, far more common form of colon cancer, called hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer. A blood test for that malignancy, which accounts for up to 15 percent of all colon cancers, may also be available within a few months.
Dr. Kenneth W. Kinzler and Dr. Steven M. Powell of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine Center in Baltimore and their colleagues report on the diagnostic method in today's issue of The New England Journal of Medicine. ""I think this is a strong example of how basic science is being rapidly translated into tools with bedside potential,"" Dr. Kinzler said. ""We can do the whole assay in a test tube in just a matter of hours.""
The test is not foolproof. In the new study, the scientists identified mutant proteins in 54 of 62 patients known to be afflicted with familial polyposis, a success rate of 87 percent. But the researchers said the figure would be higher in many situations, particularly when there are others in the family with the trait. In such cases the results of the tests on the family members can be compared against each other. But Dr. Kinzer said people with no hereditary link who have unusually high numbers of polyps might also wish to be tested to see if they bear the trait. Drugs Being Developed
Another report in the same issue of The Journal shows that removing polyps is an effective strategy for preventing colon cancer.",1993-12-30 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,adenomatous polyposis
292,Promising Drug Fails in Test Involving a Kind of Cancer,"Hopes that an anti-inflammtory drug might prevent a form of hereditary colon cancer by thwarting it in its precancerous stages in young people are dimming with the publication of new research results.
The drug, sulindac, initially looked promising for that purpose because earlier experiments showed that it could reduce the number of precancerous polyps in the colons of patients who had already developed them as a result of a disorder called familial adenomatous polyposis. In those patients, sulindac and anti-inflammatory drugs like it can hold off colon cancer for several years.
In the normal course of familial adenomatous polyposis, hundreds to thousands of polyps develop in the colon up to about age 30, when they begin to turn cancerous. The disorder results from a genetic defect and is fairly common, occurring in about 1 person in 8,000.
In this four-year experiment, being published in today's issue of The New England Journal of Medicine, researchers gave the drug to people 8 to 25 years old who were found by genetic analysis to be certain to develop the disorder.",2002-04-04 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,adenomatous polyposis
293,Q & A,"Genetic Risk of Cancer
Q. What cancers are known to be inherited?
A. ''There is much more sporadic cancer than there is inherited cancer,'' said Dr. Dawn Willis, a scientific program director with the American Cancer Society. ''Only when two first-degree relatives like a mother, father, sister or brother have the same cancer do you start looking for a genetic link.
''Even within the kinds of cancer where such a link is known, the genetically linked ones are a small subset. For example, there are at least two kinds of breast cancer that have a strong genetic link, but that is less than 5 percent of all breast cancers. The same genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, are involved in ovarian cancer, and there the link is stronger, accounting for perhaps 8 percent of ovarian cancer over all, but it is a much rarer disease.''
In colon cancer, familial adenomatous polyposis is very strongly associated with the FAP gene, but it is a rare defect. Hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer involves a defect of the DNA repair gene and is found in 10 percent to 12 percent of colon cancers. Other rare, inherited cancers include childhood thyroid cancer and retinoblastoma, an eye malignancy.
''There are probably genetic links in other diseases, but they probably involve not a single gene but multiple mutations,'' she said. C. CLAIBORNE RAY",2002-04-09 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,adenomatous polyposis
294,CANCER OF COLON IS BELIEVED LINKED TO DEFECT IN GENE,"Colon cancers, together with the much smaller number of rectal cancers, are the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. The American Cancer Society estimates that 145,000 new cases of colon and rectal cancer develop in the United States every year and that 60,000 people die of the diseases.
The finding is the latest in a series of recent advances in finding defective genes that contribute to several important diseases. The advances have been made possible by new techniques of dissecting and analyzing genetic material. Genes are usually the genetic instructions for production of one or another protein necessary to cells and their functions. Rampant Cell Growth
Sir Walter and his colleagues believe the gene for which they are searching helps control the production of cell growth substances. Normally a person will have two copies of any gene. When both copies are inactivated or missing, the control fails, cell growth becomes rampant and in some cases the cells become cancerous.
The new discovery came through studies of families in which an inherited disease that often precedes colon cancer is particularly common. In this disorder, familial adenomatous polyposis, the patient's large intestine, or colon, becomes virtually carpeted with polyps, some of which become malignant. Patients with the disorder have a greatly heightened risk of colon cancer, but they account for a relatively small number of colon cancers.
In such patients the scientists found variants in the genetic material that serves as markers indicating the proximity of a gene defect on chromosome 5, one of the 23 pairs of chromosomes that carry all of a human's genetic blueprint. In families in which the familial cancers were common, the patients in whom the cancers developed were almost always those who inherited the key markers. The markers were lacking in family members who did not develop cancers.",1987-08-13 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,adenomatous polyposis
295,"Good Pill, Bad Pill: Science Makes It Hard to Decipher","In the meantime, scientists say they are reeling from the discouraging news about drugs once thought to hold so much promise.
First Vioxx was withdrawn from the market. Then, last week, Celebrex turned out to increase the risk of heart attacks in a similar colon polyp prevention study. (Those polyp data have not yet been analyzed.) Bextra, it turned out, increased heart attack risk in patients who had had heart surgery. And on Monday, even Aleve, the over-the-counter pain reliever, fell under suspicion. In a study asking whether it or Celebrex could prevent Alzheimer's disease, Aleve patients had a 50 percent greater rate of heart problems, which is a small increase that may not be statistically significant. The study was halted anyway, in today's atmosphere of extreme caution.
All this points to troubling realities in the calculus of risk versus benefit.
What if you are at high risk of colon cancer? Do you take Celebrex? Or what if you have arthritis and end up with a choice of a drug that can cause ulcers and heart attacks or one that confers a greater risk of heart attacks, but does not cause ulcers?
""This is where it all becomes murky,"" said Dr. Daniel L. Simmons, the director of the Cancer Research Center at Brigham Young University and a discoverer of the COX-2 enzyme. The discovery led to the development of Vioxx, Celebrex and Bextra, the drugs that block the enzyme.
And what if you are a drug company, wondering whether to pour money into a long study of a drug that might prevent cancer? The Vioxx and Celebrex stories illustrate the chance a company takes. Pfizer still sells Celebrex, but stock prices in both companies plummeted with the news of their drugs' risks, and Merck faces a raft of patients' lawsuits.
Yet cancer prevention trials take years and involve healthy people, magnifying the risk that some drug dangers will emerge, scientists say.
""If you are talking about treating otherwise healthy people for years and years and years with drugs, it is almost impossible to be sure that in some relatively small fraction of patients, there won't be side effects, even severe side effects,"" said Dr. Bert Vogelstein, a colon cancer researcher and Howard Hughes investigator at Johns Hopkins University.",2004-12-22 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,adenomatous polyposis
296,Arthritis Drug Gains An Anti-Polyps Role,"An anti-inflammatory drug already used to combat arthritis was approved by the Food and Drug Administration today for treatment of a rare genetic disorder that causes patients to develop large numbers of intestinal polyps.
The drug, Celebrex, made by the Searle division of the Monsanto Company, is one of a class of nonsteroidal drugs called COX-2 inhibitors that work by suppressing an enzyme that causes inflammation. Since it was introduced in January, Celebrex has generated more than $1 billion in sales to arthritis patients.
Now it can also be marketed for treatment of those with the intestinal condition, familial adenomatous polyposis, which greatly increases the risk of developing colon and rectal cancer at an early age. The F.D.A. emphasized that Celebrex should be used only in addition to the current treatment, which typically entails removal of much of the lower intestine by early adulthood, with monitoring of any remaining intestine.
In a six-month accelerated trial involving 83 patients, those who received Celebrex developed 28 percent fewer polyps than those who took a placebo. The main side effects were diarrhea and indigestion.",1999-12-24 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,adenomatous polyposis
297,Specializing in the Genetics of Cancer,"A. A woman who has a significant family history of breast cancer, where we can look at it and say, ''It looks like you might have a 50 percent chance of inheriting a gene.'' She had a parent who is affected, one or two siblings affected, a grandparent affected. It also depends on how anxious someone is. If a woman is so incredibly anxious about developing breast cancer that she can't function, it might be appropriate for her to have the test.
Like prenatal diagnosis with amniocentesis, I can tell you what tests can be done and what are the disadvantage and the advantages of the test. But with breast cancer, what are you going to do if you know you're positive and carry a gene? For another thing, with a certain mutation within the BRCA1 gene, you have an 85 percent chance to develop breast cancer. Some women, however, carry the gene but never develop the disease.
Q. If you test positive for a cancer gene, how high is the actual risk of getting the disease?
A. That is very unclear. It differs not only from gene to gene, but it differs depending where the mutation is located within the gene. Your risk for ovarian cancer might be 30 percent if the mutation is at at one end of the gene and 60 percent if it is at at the other end.
There are some people who are going to test positive and we're going to say, ''Yes, you have a mutation in BRCA1, but this is a new mutation we've never seen in any other family, so we don't really know what it means.'' So it's possible to get tested and say, ''We're not really sure what this means and what your risk is.''
Q. Once you determine that a woman is highly at risk for breast cancer, can anything be done to prevent or delay onset?
A. No. But it will give you the opportunity to consult with your physician and establish a surveillance schedule for early detection and treatment should tumors develop. For instance, we would recommend clinical breast exams every six months instead of annual exams and yearly mammograms as opposed to every two years from age 40 to 50. It will also allow you to alter certain aspects of your diet and exercise routines, thus possibly reducing the risk for cancer.
Genetic testing is probably a better idea for colon cancer than for breast cancer because there are rare types of colon cancer -- such as familial adenomatous polyposis that develops in adolescence -- where prophylactic surgery can greatly reduce your risk. On the other hand, preventive surgery for breast cancer is somewhat controversial.",1997-01-05 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,adenomatous polyposis

The findings suggest that certain preventive strategies may be effective in the future, like looking for the bacteria in the colons of people getting colonoscopies.
If the microbes are present, the patients might warrant more frequent screening; eventually people at high risk for colon cancer may be vaccinated against at least one of the bacterial strains.",2018-02-01 19:00:27,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,adenomatous polyposis
299,NEW WAYS TO DETECT POLYPS USED AGAINST CANCER,"However, bowel cancer is one of the most preventable forms of cancer. That led the American Cancer Society and the National Cancer Institute to start campaigns recently to educate doctors and the public about ways to detect benign polyps, to prevent colon and rectum cancer and to detect cancers at their earliest stages when they are most curable.
Mr. Reagan's polyp measured four millimeters, or about one-sixth of an inch. That is about as small as such growths can be to be detected, according to Dr. Franklin K. Yee, a surgeon practicing in Sacramento who teaches at the University of California at Davis.
Most doctors believe that polyps are the first step in the development of cancer of the bowel. Studies have shown that many such growths develop into cancers in a process that takes several years. However, if a benign polyp is entirely removed, cancer will not develop at that location in the colon. Procedure Improved
Until recent years the sigmoidoscopy was performed by inserting a rigid steel tube through the anus and into the colon, or lower part of the bowel, for a distance of up to 25 centimeters.
Over the past five years or so, thinner, flexible fiberoptic colonoscopes have replaced the rigid tubes. As a result, the colonoscope examination is much less uncomfortable. Also, doctors can examine the entire colon up to about 150 centimeters, thereby detecting more polyps at earlier stages in their development.
The White House said Mr. Reagan's polyp was found 40 centimeters from the anus.
The newer colonoscope examinations take about 15 minutes to perform and have been done on tens of thousands of people, many of whom, like Mr. Reagan, went to their doctors for routine medical checkups and were surprised to learn they had benign polyps. No Sedation Required
An examination requires no sedation. Patients are instructed to eat nothing for about 12 hours beforehand and have an enema before the examination. The procedure is done in doctors' offices or on an outpatient basis at hospitals, and patients can go on with their normal daily activities afterward.",1984-05-20 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,polyp
300,2 Apparently Benign Polyps Found in Reagan,"''The President continues to be in excellent health,'' Dr. Hutton said Reagans Leave for Retreat Shortly after his checkup, Mr. Reagan left for a weekend at the Camp David Presidential retreat in Maryland. As he walked to his helicopter for the trip, Mr. Reagan smiled broadly and made an ''A-O.K.'' sign with his thumb and forefinger. His wife, Nancy, also gave a sign that all was well.
Mr. Reagan did not speak to reporters, but when he was asked how he felt, he took a tiny skip and then continued his slow pace to the helicopter.
The examination today was described as a routine office procedure. It marked a departure from past practice of Mr. Reagan's doctors in that it was performed at the White House, not at Bethesda Naval Medical Center in Maryland. Mr. Reagan's three earlier cancer checkups were done at Bethesda, where he underwent the cancer surgery.
Mr. Reagan's cancerous polyp was detected in a colonoscopy on July 12, 1985. The next day Mr. Reagan underwent major abdominal surgery to remove the polyp, which was found to be malignant.
At that time Dr. Steven A. Rosenberg, chief of cancer surgery at the National Cancer Institute, who participated in the operation, said Mr. Reagan had a greater than 50 percent chance of outliving his cancer for five years, the standard period that doctors use to measure cancer survival. Some experts believe the prognosis should have been stated more positively.
Whatever the odds, experts agree that Mr. Reagan is now in a critical period: When colon cancer reappears, usually elsewhere in the body, more than two-thirds of the time it is within two years. Aims of 6-Month Checkups
Mr. Reagan's doctors said he would undergo a checkup every six months. According to standard medical practice, such post-colon surgery examinations have two main purposes:
* To detect new, potentially cancerous polyps. Such detection is usually made with a colonoscope.
* To detect any recurrence of the previous colon cancer. Doctors rely on a variety of tests such as CAT scans, chest X-rays and blood tests for this.",1987-06-27 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,polyp
301,REAGAN'S POLYPS NOT CANCEROUS LAB TESTS SHOW,"Dr. Sidney J. Winawer, chief of gastroenterology at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City, said in a telephone interview today that ''it really doesn't matter'' which kind of polyp was found in Mr. Reagan ''as long as they were all benign.'' He noted that according to the White House the polyps ''were minuscule, extremely tiny, only 1 or 2 millimeters'' in size, or smaller in diameter than the lead of a pencil. 'Insignificant and Minuscule'
Dr. Winawer said before the examination that it would be unusual to find new polyps only six months after Mr. Reagan's operation to remove a colon cancer, but he said today that he had been thinking in terms of finding a ''significant'' polyp. ''A 1- to 2-millimeter polyp is so insignificant and minuscule it's not even worth talking about,'' he added.
Dr. Winawer said discovery of the new polyps was not an indication that Mr. Reagan was destined to develop cancer again but rather that he ''still needs a follow-up program'' to check for polyps and remove them before they become bigger or possibly malignant. If follow-up checks are done at proper intervals, he said, they will yield ''the expected results - small and insignificant polyps that can be easily removed.''
Dr. Winawer said removal of the polyps Friday was ''a very important preventive measure'' because it ''prevents the growth and development'' of the polyps into cancer. ''It's probably the single most important thing they can do,'' he said.
In keeping information about Mr. Reagan's medical examination to a minimum, the White House was following a practice that developed after the surgery in July.
In the last year, Nancy Reagan, the President's wife, who is the daughter of a physician, has made it clear that she was opposed to detailed disclosure of her husband's physical examinations. It was not known, however, if Mrs. Reagan wanted to limit public information about the Friday check-up, or if the President himself or his chief of staff, Donald T. Regan, wanted to keep details private. Periodic Colonoscopies
The White House statement Friday night did not identify the physicians who performed the examination, which the statement said included blood tests, X-rays and a CAT scan, which provides detailed pictures of the brain, lungs, pancreas and other organs.",1986-01-19 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,polyp
302,DOCTORS REMOVE 4 'SMALL' POLYPS IN REAGAN'S COLON,"Dr. Hutton, in his statement, said that the newly found polyps ''show no evidence of a recurrence of the cancer found in July 1985.'' Other physicians not connected with Mr. Reagan's case said that while new cancerous polyps could develop, a recurrence or spread from the one that was removed in 1985 was not likely be found in new polyps but rather elsewhere, such as in the liver, lungs or lymph nodes in the abdomen and pelvis. Another Crucial Test
Albert R. Brashear, the deputy White House spokesman, said in answer to a question that Dr. Hutton's statement meant that ''we saw no evidence of the recurrence of the cancer'' in the colonoscopy and the chest X-rays. ''If we had found evidence of recurrence of the cancer,'' he said, ''it would have been noted in the statement.''
A more definitive answer on whether Mr. Reagan has a recurrence or spread of his colon cancer cannot come until he has another crucial test, CAT scan X-rays of his abdomen and pelvis. This test will be performed on Tuesday, a day after Mr. Reagan's prostate surgery, Mr. Brashear said.
The prostate is a walnut-size gland that exists only in men and surrounds the urethra, the tube that carries urine from the bladder. In the trans-urethral resection, a long tube will be inserted through the urethral opening to the prostate. The instrument has an electric wire loop that can be used to chip away prostate tissue and to stop bleeding.
The stress test of Mr. Reagan's cardiovascular system today was one in a series he has had in annual checkups since before becoming President. Mr. Reagan's doctors have reported the results of the earlier ones as normal. In the test, the patient walks at an increasingly faster pace on a treadmill while monitored by an electrocardiogram. By looking at portions of the electrocardiogram, the doctors try to determine if there is evidence of coronary artery disease.
In the lung function test, Mr. Reagan blew into machines that measured the amount of air he could inhale and exhale to test whether there were any physiological changes that could be subtle clues to lung problems.
A team, largely from the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., which flew here with their surgical equipment this weekend, will do the prostate operation. Dr. David Utz of the Mayo Clinic is expected to do the surgery, assisted by Dr. John Randolph Beahrs, a urologist who trained at the Mayo Clinic and who practices in St. Paul. Dr. Beahrs's father, Dr. Oliver Beahrs, a retired Mayo Clinic general surgeon who was a friend and associate of Nancy Reagan's father, Dr. Loyal Davis, will also be present.",1987-01-05 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,polyp
303,"REAGAN'S POLYPS ARE NOT CANCER, HIS DOCTOR SAYS","''The final laboratory evaluation of the two intestinal polyps removed during the President's routine follow-up examination yesterday has been completed and both are benign,'' Dr. Smith said. ''The President was informed of the results by his physician at Camp David this morning.''
White House officials would not comment beyond the two-sentence statement.
The examination was part of a prescribed regimen to check every six months for any recurrence of potentially cancerous growths in Mr. Reagan's intestine.
Dr. Henry Binder, a professor of medicine at the Yale Medical School, said in a telephone interview that the discovery of the polyps while they were still small demonstrated the superb care that the President was receiving as well as the importance of six-month checkups for people who have had a previous experience with colon cancer.
''Individuals who have had colon cancer have a propensity for forming more polyps over time,'' he said. Dr. Binder said certain growths in the intestine, especially villous adenomatous polyps, may eventually develop into cancer. But frequent examinations and treatment can prevent that.
''Within a six-month time frame, a colon cancer is not going to develop,'' Dr. Binder said. Moreover, the tiny size of the polyps removed from Mr. Reagan's colon on Friday, he said, suggested strongly that they were detected very early.",1986-06-22 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,polyp

307,A Gentler Type of Colonoscopy Is Found Effective,"''It really matters what method you're using and how you prepare the colon,'' Dr. Pickhardt said.
But, he cautioned, virtual colonoscopy patients still must undergo the onerous process of cleansing their colons of fecal material before the test and they must insert a small tube into their rectums and pump air into their colons during the scan, a procedure that can be uncomfortable. And if the scan finds polyps, they may need a traditional colonoscopy to cut them out.
Most health insurers also do not pay for the procedure. ''What is being charged varies from $500 to over $2,000,'' Dr. Pickhardt said. ''Patients are paying out of pocket. It's what the market allows.''
Doctors said that virtual colonoscopy appeals to some who shun other screening methods. Many people abhor the idea of sedation, used in traditional colonoscopy. Others worry about the risks -- most notably a chance of one in several thousand that the colon will be perforated. That requires major emergency abdominal surgery.
In the new study, about 54 percent of patients said regular colonoscopy was more uncomfortable than virtual, about 38 percent said virtual was more uncomfortable and about 8 percent were undecided. But almost 70 percent of the patients said virtual colonoscopy was more convenient.
''Some of the appeal of virtual colonoscopy is its name,'' said Dr. Douglas K. Rex, a professor of medicine at Indiana University and president of the American College of Gastroenterology. He added that many experts call it ''C.T. colonography'' instead. ''Some of the appeal goes away when you call it that name,'' he said.
For all its promise, medical experts say, there are problems to be worked out with virtual colonoscopy. One is when to refer such patients for regular colonoscopy. In general, the larger the polyp, the more worrisome it is. But do you use 10 millimeters in diameter as a cutoff point? If so, then 3 to 5 percent of patients will need a regular colonoscopy to cut out the polyps found on a virtual one. Do you choose six to nine millimeters? Then at least 30 percent will need traditional colonoscopy.
Colon cancer experts debate the importance of lesions as small as six to nine millimeters, but with conventional colonoscopy, doctors often cut off every polyp they find, so size has not been an issue. It becomes one with virtual colonoscopy.",2003-12-02 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,polyp
308,"Done Right, Colonoscopy Takes Time, Study Finds","The whole procedure generally takes about 30 minutes. The doctor spends about eight minutes inserting the scope and then uses the rest of the time on the critical withdrawal phase, said Dr. Robert L. Barclay, a member of the gastroenterology team that participated in the journal study. In that study, physicians who spent six minutes or more on withdrawal had the best results.
“Doing a thorough exam means looking behind folds in the lining, going back and looking at a segment again, washing away a little bit of stool residue and, of course, removing polyps,” said Dr. Barclay, who practices with Rockford Gastroenterology Associates in Rockford, Ill. “All of these things take time. A physician who doesn’t do any of this is able to remove the scope more quickly.”

Because colonoscopy typically involves sedation, there is usually no way for a patient to tell how thorough or careful a doctor is being or how long the examination is taking. But there are ways to judge beforehand whether, in general, a doctor tends to rush procedures.
“It’s fair to ask how many procedures a doctor does in a day,” said Dr. Deborah A. Nagle, chief of the section of colon and rectal surgery at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. “If a colonoscopy is supposed to take half an hour, you don’t want someone who is doing 40 in a morning. A doctor who is doing about a dozen between 8 a.m. and noon makes sense.”
Other questions can also help determine a doctor’s overall skill at performing colonoscopy. The first concerns training. Gastroenterologists perform the majority of the four million colonoscopies conducted each year in this country, followed by colorectal surgeons. Both kinds of specialists must learn how to perform colonoscopies as part of their training.
“Colonoscopy is learned through repetitive practice, so it’s important to make sure a doctor has been trained in a setting that allows the opportunity to do many,” Dr. Nagle said. “Asking a doctor how many he has performed is a reasonable question. A couple of hundred is a sufficient number, but it’s common for an experienced doctor to have done thousands.”",2006-12-19 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,polyp
309,Cancer Study Backs Post‐Surgery Drugs,"Colorectal cancer will cause an estimated total of 49.000 deaths in this country this year, and 99,000 Americans will be diagnosed as having the disease. It is readily curable by surgery alone when it is detected early, which can be done through annual colon examinations using a proctosigmoidoscope (generally recommended for people over 40).
Reporting in yesterday's issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association, Drs. Min C. Le and Stuart T. Ross of Nassau Hospital in Mineola said that, based on their study of 213 patients, the curability of more advanced colorectal cancer could be dramatically increased using an old cancer drug in a new way to wipe out possible hidden colonies of cancer cells.
According to their report, if a short course of treatment with the drug 5‐fluorouracil commonly called 5‐FU, was given starting four to six weeks after surgery, 57.5 percent of patients with “Stage III” disease were alive and free of cancer five years later, compared with 24.3 percent who were treated by surgery alone.
Patients are classified as Stage III if the cancer has spread to the nearby lymph nodes, which increases the likelihood that some cancer cells have already escaped from the area and have gone to the far reaches of the body.
In the Long Island study, 81.6 percent of patients with Stage II colorectal cancer were alive and well five years later if they received the drug treatment, compared with 58.5 percent treated with surgery alone. Stage II patients have cancer, that has penetrated the intestinal wall and adjacent structures but has not yet reached the lymph nodes.",1976-06-29 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,colorectal carcinoma
310,New Class of Drugs Shows More Promise in Treating Cancer,"Patients whose tumors produced a protein called PD-L1, which looks to be another predictor of success for certain checkpoint inhibitors, fared even better. Among just those patients, median survival was 17.2 months in the group receiving Opdivo and nine months for those getting docetaxel.
“In a randomized trial I don’t think people have ever been able to see this kind of difference,” said Dr. Pasi A. Janne, a lung cancer specialist at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, who was not involved in the study.
The trial, paid for by Bristol-Myers, involved 582 patients with advanced cancer who had already had treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy like carboplatin. This summer, Bristol intends to apply to have Opdivo approved to treat nonsquamous lung cancer.
In other studies discussed at the conference on Friday, Opdivo significantly shrank tumors in 19 percent of patients with advanced liver cancer and Keytruda in 25 percent of patients with head and neck cancer. There is now only one drug approved for liver cancer, Nexavar from Bayer and Amgen.
Other studies have shown the checkpoint inhibitors can help some patients with kidney, bladder, stomach and other forms of cancer. But there have been few signs of effectiveness with colorectal, prostate or pancreatic cancers.
Why do the drugs work so well for some cancers and barely at all for others?
One thought is that lung cancer and melanoma are often caused by things that damage DNA — tobacco smoke and ultraviolet radiation. They thus “have tons of mutations, hundreds of mutations per tumor,” said Dr. Diaz, more than most other tumors. That might make it easier for the immune system to recognize the cancer cells as something to be destroyed.
But some cancers have even more mutations — those with a genetic defect known as mismatch repair deficiency. This deficiency prevents the repair of changes in DNA that can arise as cells divide, allowing mutations to accumulate.",2015-05-29 18:00:49,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,colorectal carcinoma
311,Cancer Doctors Cite Risks of Drinking Alcohol,"“The more you drink, the higher the risk,” said Dr. Clifford A. Hudis, the chief executive of ASCO. “It’s a pretty linear dose-response.”
Even those who drink moderately, defined by the Centers for Disease Control as one daily drink for women and two for men, face nearly a doubling of the risk for mouth and throat cancer and more than double the risk of squamous cell carcinoma of the esophagus, compared to nondrinkers. Moderate drinkers also face elevated risks for cancers of the voice box, female breast cancer and colorectal cancers.
The risk for heavy drinkers — defined as eight or more drinks a week for women and 15 or more a week for men, including binge drinkers — are multiples higher. Heavy drinkers face roughly five times the risk of mouth and throat cancers and squamous cell esophageal cancers than nondrinkers, nearly three times the risk of cancers of the voice box or larynx, double the risk of liver cancer, as well as increased risks for female breast cancer and colorectal cancer.
“If you look at these figures, you see alcohol is a contributing factor; certainly it has a causal role,” Dr. Hudis said.
The International Agency for Research on Cancer, which is part of the World Health Organization, first classified the consumption of alcoholic beverages as carcinogenic to humans in 1987, tying consumption to cancers of the mouth, throat, voice box, esophagus and liver, said Susan Gapstur, vice president for epidemiology at the American Cancer Society.
Since then, she said, more and more evidence has accumulated tying alcohol to a broader group of cancers, including colorectal cancer and, in women, breast cancer. A more recent I.A.R.C. report concluded that alcohol “is a cause of cancers of the oral cavity, pharynx, larynx, esophagus, colorectum, liver and female breast.” (The esophageal cancer is largely specific to squamous cell carcinoma.)
“The story of alcohol has been quite consistent and has been peeled away like an onion over time, and we’re continuing to learn more about the mechanisms involved,” Dr. Gapstur said. “We don’t have randomized trials, but sometimes when you start looking at the coherence of all the evidence, including the observational epidemiology, the lab studies, the mechanistic studies, you begin to see a picture and get more clarity.”",2017-11-07 21:36:51,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,colorectal carcinoma

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force said on Tuesday, however, that there still isn’t enough evidence to recommend total-body screenings and declined to take a position on the practice.
In short, the 17-member independent panel said that it could not determine — after reviewing thousands of research papers and studies from around the world — whether the benefits of screening outweighed the potential for harm if unnecessary or excessive procedures were performed.
One particular study that the task force relied upon concluded that full-body screenings only reduced deaths from melanoma by one death per 100,000 people screened.",2016-07-26 19:33:21,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,colorectal carcinoma

Re ''Cancer 'Prevention' Is Big Seller, but Medical Experts Are Divided'' (front page, Jan. 11):
Only prospective, randomized studies, comparing screened and unscreened populations, can prove that screening saves lives. The ability of screening for prostatic carcinoma by determining levels of prostate-specific antigen or for lung cancer by spiral computer-automated tomography to save lives has not, in fact, been proved.
Such studies have, however, long been completed on mammography for breast cancer and colonoscopy for colorectal cancer.
They provide unequivocal evidence that screening for these tumors does indeed save lives.

314,Trying to Estimate Cancer Rates in Ancient Times,"When they excavated a Scythian burial mound in the Russian region of Tuva about 10 years ago, archaeologists literally struck gold. Crouched on the floor of a dark inner chamber were two skeletons, a man and a woman, surrounded by royal garb from 27 centuries ago: headdresses and capes adorned with gold horses, panthers and other sacred beasts.
But for paleopathologists  scholars of ancient disease  the richest treasure was the abundance of tumors that had riddled almost every bone of the man’s body. The diagnosis: the oldest known case of metastasizing prostate cancer.
The prostate itself had disintegrated long ago. But malignant cells from the gland had migrated according to a familiar pattern and left identifiable scars. Proteins extracted from the bone tested positive for PSA, prostate specific antigen.
Often thought of as a modern disease, cancer has always been with us. Where scientists disagree is on how much it has been amplified by the sweet and bitter fruits of civilization. Over the decades archaeologists have made about 200 possible cancer sightings dating to prehistoric times. But considering the difficulties of extracting statistics from old bones, is that a little or a lot?",2010-12-27 21:11:14,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,colorectal carcinoma

In the trial, sponsored by the National Cancer Institute, patients who received Avastin along with standard chemotherapy drugs had a median survival of 12.5 months, compared with 10.2 months for those receiving only the chemotherapy.
Genentech's shares soared $10.92, or 25 percent, to close at $55. The company, which is based in South San Francisco, said it hoped to gain an additional approval for Avastin as a treatment for lung cancer. The drug was approved last February for colorectal cancer and had sales of $555 million in 2004.

316,Psoriasis Tied to Increased Cancer Risk,"Havin g psoriasis is associated wit h an increased risk of cancer, a new review of studies concludes.
Researchers, writing in JAMA Dermatology, combined data from 58 studies and found that, over all, compared with people without the condition, psoriasis of any degree of severity was associated with an 18 percent increased risk for cancer, and severe psoriasis with a 22 percent increase. Cancer mortality was elevated in all cases of severe psoriasis.
For some specific types of cancer, the risk was even higher. For example, they found that severe psoriasis was associated with more than 11 times the risk for squamous cell carcinoma (a skin cancer), about double the risk for esophageal and liver cancer, and a 45 percent increased risk for pancreatic cancer.
Any degree of psoriasis, severe or not, was significantly associated with colorectal cancer, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and cancers of the kidney and pancreas, among others.
The reason for the connection is unclear, but there is a known link between chronic inflammation and cancer, and this may help explain the association.",2019-10-16 14:00:05,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,colorectal carcinoma
317,"Cancers Can Vanish Without Treatment, but How?","Call it the arrow of cancer. Like the arrow of time, it was supposed to point in one direction. Cancers grew and worsened.
But as a paper in The Journal of the American Medical Association noted last week, data from more than two decades of screening for breast and prostate cancer call that view into question. Besides finding tumors that would be lethal if left untreated, screening appears to be finding many small tumors that would not be a problem if they were left alone, undiscovered by screening. They were destined to stop growing on their own or shrink, or even, at least in the case of some breast cancers, disappear.
“The old view is that cancer is a linear process,” said Dr. Barnett Kramer, associate director for disease prevention at the National Institutes of Health. “A cell acquired a mutation, and little by little it acquired more and more mutations. Mutations are not supposed to revert spontaneously.”
So, Dr. Kramer said, the image was “an arrow that moved in one direction.” But now, he added, it is becoming increasingly clear that cancers require more than mutations to progress. They need the cooperation of surrounding cells and even, he said, “the whole organism, the person,” whose immune system or hormone levels, for example, can squelch or fuel a tumor.",2009-10-26 19:51:57,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,colorectal carcinoma
318,"Cilia, an Antenna and Motor on Cells","At first they cannot see at night. Then daytime vision fails, and by age 5 or 10, these children are blind. Some become extremely obese and develop diabetes and kidney disease.
The crushing condition is known as Bardet-Biedl syndrome, and it is caused by inherited defects in the child’s primary cilia  solitary slivers that poke out of almost every cell in the body. These are not the wisps that wave Rockette-like in our airways. They are stiff, tiny, nearly transparent structures, sometimes as little as one-thousandth the size of the cell. Only one sticks out of each cell, and it acts as both an antenna and a machine to process signals essential for development and survival.
Largely ignored for a century as vestigial, primary cilia are now emerging as pivotal players in the subtle shifts of signaling that shape the fetus and assure normal adult cell growth. Powerful genetic and imaging tools have opened a window into these machines, fueling a flurry of research intended to clarify their role in health and disease.
“Primary cilia are turning out to be a kind of signaling machine that no one had appreciated,” said Matthew Scott, a geneticist at Stanford Medical School. “It’s as if there was a shed out back with all sorts of weird machinery, and hardly anyone had ever looked in.

320,He Had Recurring Pain for Nearly a Decade,"It was his usual practice, when possible, to extend his evaluation beyond the colon into the last section of the ileum, the tail end of the small intestine. Most gastroenterologists limit their screening examinations of healthy, asymptomatic patients to the colon. The ileum is not scoped during a routine screening because doing so takes more time and because the chance of finding something significant is small. But Chan had been trained by a doctor who specialized in inflammatory bowel diseases like Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis. A simple colonoscopy will reveal ulcerative colitis, when present. But only half of those with Crohn’s disease will have evidence of it in their colons. The chance of making that diagnosis goes up markedly when the terminal ileum is included.
As Chan advanced his scope, he could see that the valve was distorted by scar tissue — so much so that the connection was too narrow for his instrument to enter. Bringing his scope as close to the opening as he could, he saw that the tissue on the other side was an angry red and dotted with ulcers. They would have to wait for the biopsies to come back, but Chan suspected Crohn’s disease. That’s impossible, the man responded. He had no G.I. symptoms at all. No pain, no diarrhea, no blood in his stools. How could he possibly have Crohn’s?
A Hidden Underlying Disease
Crohn’s disease is an autoimmune disorder in which antibodies, the body’s chief defense against infection, mistakenly attack the digestive tract as if it were a foreign invader. Although it can affect the G.I. tract anywhere, it is most frequently found in the terminal ileum. Most patients with Crohn’s will have pain and diarrhea — but not all. In studies of patients with known Crohn’s disease, one in six will have no symptoms at all.
The biopsy results came back consistent with Crohn’s. So did blood tests designed to help diagnose inflammatory bowel disease. But it wasn’t the diseased bowel that was giving the man the pain in his buttocks. It was an associated disorder, a type of arthritis known as sacroiliitis — an inflammation of the joint between the pelvic girdle and the sacrum, the triangular bone that forms the connection between the hips. Although the reason this happens is not well understood, it appears that some of the immune cells misdirected to attack the gut can also attack the joints. Up to 39 percent of patients with an inflammatory bowel disease develop arthritis in some form. And up to 20 percent will develop the arthritis before getting the bowel disease. In this patient’s case, it’s hard to know which came first, because the bowel disease was discovered almost by accident.
To Treat or Not to Treat
Because Crohn’s is usually painful and is associated with complications including bowel perforation, anemia and malnutrition, patients are usually treated with medications to calm down the immune system and reduce the inflammation. These are powerful drugs that suppress the immune system. They are very effective at controlling the pain and destruction but can leave a patient open to infection. Because of that, it’s less clear how to treat patients with asymptomatic disease. For those with no pain and no signs of inflammation, watchful waiting is a common strategy.
The same type of medications are used to treat the arthritis associated with inflammatory bowel disease. The physician wasn’t sure if it made sense for him to use an immune-suppressing medicine while seeing sick patients. His rheumatologist, seeing him put the pad on his seat before gently lowering himself onto the chair, was much less uncertain. She had put many people on these medications, she told him — some of them doctors. Most did fine. He agreed to start taking it. The effect was immediate and amazing. His pain — a regular visitor for nearly a decade — is gone. Even at the end of the day, his walk to and from his car is painless. He still uses the pad at times; those bones are still a little tender. But the rest of him feels great.",2020-09-15 09:00:09,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,crohn disease

Over all, 5.5 percent of people with I.B.D. developed dementia, compared with 1.4 percent of controls. After adjusting for cerebrovascular disease, hypertension, traumatic brain injury, diabetes, smoking and other risk factors for dementia, they found that people with I.B.D. were almost three times as likely as the controls to develop vascular or other types of dementia, and more than six times as likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease.

324,Five Things I Wish I’d Known Before My Chronic Illness,"Your relationships change
It’s hard to be a good employee when you need extended time off. It’s hard to be a good friend when you cancel plans last minute. It’s hard to be a good partner or parent when you barely have the energy to get out of bed. No matter how much you try to explain, people expect you to get better already — and when you don’t, they resent you, consciously or not. Some relationships end entirely, casualties of an unfair and misunderstood illness, while others get stronger as you find your true support system.
But most of all, your relationship with yourself changes. You grieve a version of yourself that doesn’t exist anymore, and a future version that looks different than you’d planned.
You might have to give up career goals, hobbies and family plans, learning a “new normal” in their place. “In trauma therapy we call this ‘integration,’ the task of integrating a new reality into one’s life and worldview,” Mr. Lundquist said. “This emotional work can look a lot like grief therapy for a passing loved one.” Try to be patient as you get to know the new version of yourself.
“Having a chronic illness is a series of continuous ups and downs where some things that work for a while won’t and so on,” said Alicia Aiello, president of Girls With Guts, an organization that empowers women with IBD and ostomies. “Be open to this change.”
Everyone offers you advice
People are compelled to offer advice about chronically ill bodies because they’re convinced a fix must exist. Here are a few of the things I’ve been told, unsolicited, to try over the years: yoga, meditation, essential oils, acupuncture, CBD oil, vaping, prayer, bone broth and [fill in the blank with the latest fad] diet. Some of these are great in conjunction with medical treatment — my doctor recommends meditation for stress relief, for example — but the advice is offered as a cure or a better alternative to whatever I’m already doing. And let’s face it, no amount of broth is going to turn off my spazzy immune system.
Chronically ill people research their diseases ad nauseam. They try more treatments than they can count. In many cases, great scientific minds can’t crack a cause or cure. So unless someone asks for your advice, don’t offer it. If you’re on the receiving end of misguided advice, say something like, “I appreciate that you’re trying to help, but my doctors and I think this treatment is best right now” or “There’s no known cure for my disease, but I’d love if you donated toward the research to find one!” You can also educate them by saying, “Thank you, but that wouldn’t help. Here’s how my disease works, and here’s the kind of treatment that’s required.”
You have to educate yourself — and everyone else
Maybe it’s because I’m a journalist, but when I was diagnosed, I dove into research. Learning as much as I could helped me feel a sense of control, so I bought every available IBD book and spent hours reading studies and forums online. I made lists of questions for my doctors and insisted they give me their personal phone numbers. I expected my friends and family to be as gung-ho as I was, but turns out, most of them never even Googled my disease. It was up to me to learn and teach — friends, family, bosses, partners — through conversations, books with passages marked, emails highlighting new research, and social media posts.",2019-02-18 22:30:01,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,crohn disease

What challenges did she have to overcome on her way to qualifying for the Rio de Janeiro Games?
For Baker, one of about 700,000 Americans who have Crohn’s disease, the answer could fill a 70-page spiral notebook, and it is not as easy as WebMD. How does one begin to explain the physical and psychosocial challenges of living with a disease — a chronic, recalcitrant gastrointestinal inflammation — that can be embarrassing to talk about? How could she describe the medications that can lose their efficacy over time, or a fatigue so fathomless it can sap your will?

327,The Worm Turns,"In the early 1990s, Joel Weinstock, a gastroenterologist, encountered a puzzle. The prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease (I.B.D.) across North America increased markedly during the 20th century. Many thought that “bad” genes would eventually explain the spike, but Weinstock didn’t buy it. In areas where fewer than two generations ago the I.B.D. incidence might have been as low as 1 in 10,000, it was now 1 in 250. A defective gene couldn’t spread that quickly, he reasoned. It had to be something in the environment. But what? Stumped, Weinstock tried turning the question around. Instead of asking what triggered I.B.D., he asked what, before the 20th century, protected against it?
At the time, Weinstock, then at the University of Iowa, was editing a book on parasitic worms. These worms, or helminths, have a paradoxical effect on the host. Rather than induce inflammation, which is the body’s typical response to invasion, the intruders calm the host immune system. They force a peace, scientists think, to avoid eviction and keep the host  their home and food source  as healthy as possible. As Weinstock considered the I.B.D. puzzle, he wondered if immune manipulation by worms could incidentally protect against other diseases.
Comparison of the prevalence of I.B.D. and surveys of worm-infestation rates revealed a telling pattern. About 10 years after improved hygiene and deworming efforts reduced worms in a given population, I.B.D. rates jumped. Weinstock had his hypothesis: after a long coevolution, the human immune system came to depend on the worms for proper functioning. When cleaner conditions and new medicines evicted the worms from our bodies, the immune system went out of kilter. “Hygiene has made our lives better,” says Weinstock, now at Tufts University. “But in the process of eliminating exposure to the 10 or 20 things that can make us sick, we’re also eliminating exposure to things that make us well.”",2008-06-29 04:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,crohn disease

Those and the new study, which was financed by the Wellcome Trust of London, demonstrate the power and reliability of the whole genome association method, which stands in contrast to the many uncorroborated claims of disease genes made previously.
“It’s now absolutely clear that this is a new dawn in the genetics of common human diseases,” said Peter Donnelly, a statistical geneticist at Oxford University who was chairman of the consortium of 50 institutions involved in the Wellcome Trust study.
The consortium compared 2,000 patients with each disease from across Britain with 3,000 healthy individuals as controls, half of whom were born in a single week in 1958. The consortium’s findings are published in today’s Nature, along with reports from two groups that largely confirm the consortium’s genomic hits in independent patient groups suffering from Crohn’s disease and Type 1 diabetes.
The consortium discovered some 24 variants strongly linked to disease, about half of which have been found already by other groups and half of which are new.
Among its most interesting findings is that genetic variants close to a gene known as PTPN2 are associated with both Crohn’s disease and Type 1 diabetes. The link may be that both are autoimmune diseases and that the gene helps regulate the immune system. Researchers hope that analysis of the gene’s operations may produce a treatment for the two diseases.",2007-06-07 04:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,crohn disease
329,"What Is Ulcerative Colitis, the Ailment Afflicting Shinzo Abe of Japan?","Ulcerative colitis, the gastrointestinal affliction that has debilitated Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan so badly that he is resigning, is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease, which is suffered by millions and can flare up unpredictably.
It irritates and inflames the innermost lining of the large intestine and rectum, causing ulcers or sores. Symptoms can include uncontrolled diarrhea, rectal bleeding, weight loss, diminished appetite, abdominal pain and frequent need to use the bathroom.
The disease can strike at a young age and worsen over time, as appeared to happen to Mr. Abe, 65. Doctors say they have also seen it develop in people in their 50s and older who had not suffered symptoms at a young age.
Inflammatory bowel disease also includes Crohn’s disease, which can disrupt the entire gastrointestinal tract.",2020-08-28 18:44:21,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,colitis
330,COLITIS RISK SEEN FOR EX-SMOKERS,"Although the benefits of giving up smoking are well known, doctors believe they have found the first apparent hazard of kicking the habit, an increased risk of a rare but serious intestinal disease called ulcerative colitis.
Dr. Edward J. Boyko, a researcher at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center in Denver who directed the study, reported the findings in Thursday's issue of The New England Journal of Medicine.
The study found that people who gave up smoking were twice as likely as those who never smoked to get ulcerative colitis. For those who continue, the risk is 40 percent lower than that faced by people who never smoked.
The cause of ulcerative colitis, a chronic inflammation of the lining of the large intestine, is not known. The disease usually strikes people from 20 to 40 years old, causing diarrhea, cramps and bloody stools.",1987-03-19 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,colitis
331,Finding Cure for Colitis,"To the Editor:
In a review of Jill Sklar's book on Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis (''Ailments Twist and Turn From Day 1 to Year's End,'' July 2), the writer notes that ''no cures have been found.''
I beg to differ. My severe case of ulcerative colitis was diagnosed five years ago.
Medications failed to control the disease, and some even threatened the health of my liver and kidneys. I eventually decided to have my colon surgically removed and replaced with an internal J-pouch created from part of my small intestine.
I no longer have severe abdominal pain. I am cured.

To my surprise, I find pleasure in the sorting, as it is one of the few moments when I can pretend I have some control over the bizarre war raging in my colon.
When I learned 11 months ago at age 29 that I had a chronic illness, I understood that my life was going to change. I knew I would stop eating certain foods, limit stress and think more strategically about when to have children. What I didn’t anticipate was the loss of control over my life that I thought I had, until the gastroenterologist uttered the words “ulcerative colitis.”
He explained that for reasons unknown, my immune system was ravaging the walls of my large intestine, mistakenly trying to fight off a nonexistent foreign invader. Short of removing the colon, he said, there was no cure  leaving me to contend with unpredictable bouts of abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, fatigue, weight loss, dehydration and night sweats. Forever.
Before my illness, I didn’t realize I had been operating on the assumption that there was an equation to explain how things played out. It was almost like physics. If I followed certain rules, I would get the desired outcomes. I wanted to lose 10 pounds. So I quit eating after 8 p.m. and watched my waist shrink.",2008-02-26 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,colitis

The condition, ulcerative colitis, can usually be treated with drugs, the researchers said, but as many as 40 percent of the patients need the operation, a colectomy, in which the colon is removed. After the operation, women had significantly lower fertility rates and used in vitro fertilization more often, the study found.
The study found that women with colitis who did not have the surgery had about the same fertility rates as women without the disease.

334,Fighting Colitis in the Computer Age,"""Anyone can develop it, but adults between the ages of 20 and 40 are most susceptible,"" said Mr. Gangi, who is 32 and developed the first signs of the disease when he was 24. ""Ten percent of the sufferers are kids under 18, and for them it can mean their growth is delayed and they develop other serious problems.
""In my case it came out of the blue, because I have always been very athletic -- I played football in high school and college -- and healthy. I found it very hard to understand what was happening, and I began to search for information at libraries and through computer networks. But I was not able to find much out there. I started to feel very isolated and alone.""
The low point came, he said, when he was on a business trip. ""I was suddenly seized with unbearable pain that later was diagnosed as being caused by an internal abscess brought on by the disease,"" he said. ""My weight had dropped from 160 to 120 pounds. One of the symptoms of the disease is that you can't retain nutrients or calories. Food goes right through you.
""I was put in the hospital, and just at that time my wife was four months pregnant with our twins. I'd say I felt the future looked very bleak. But thankfully I was treated successfully with massive doses of antibiotics and medications, and my condition stabilized. I'm feeling pretty good now. I'm on an immune-suppressant medication, which follows one school of thought that Crohn's is linked to an overactive immune system. But I have to go for a white blood cell count every week so that my immune system isn't too suppressed."" Combining Forces
Mr. Gangi said he found it very difficult to cope with the disease alone until a friend put him in touch with a chapter of the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation of America, a nonprofit research-oriented volunteer health organization with 70 chapters nationwide.

335,Inflammatory Bowel Disease Tied to Increased Dementia Risk,"People with inflammatory bowel disease — either Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis — may be at increased risk for dementia, a new study has found.
Researchers matched 1,742 Taiwanese patients who were older than 45 and had inflammatory bowel disease, or I.B.D., with 17,420 controls free of the disease, following them for up to 16 years. The study is online in the journal Gut.
Over all, 5.5 percent of people with I.B.D. developed dementia, compared with 1.4 percent of controls. After adjusting for cerebrovascular disease, hypertension, traumatic brain injury, diabetes, smoking and other risk factors for dementia, they found that people with I.B.D. were almost three times as likely as the controls to develop vascular or other types of dementia, and more than six times as likely to develop Alzheimer’s disease.
Patients with I.B.D. developed dementia at an average age about seven years younger than that of the controls, and the longer they had I.B.D., the more likely they were to become demented.",2020-07-02 15:45:32,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,colitis
336,Crohn’s Disease and Colitis Are Linked to Mutant Gene,"There are treatments for Crohn’s, but no cure. Anti-inflammatory drugs, immune system suppressants, antibiotics and surgery are all used, with varying degrees of success. Most treatments have side effects that can range from trivial to debilitating.
Various causes for Crohn’s have been proposed, including diet, infections with specific bacteria, possible environmental factors and immune system disorders. But most scientists believe that an immune response to normally beneficial intestinal bacteria in genetically susceptible people is the cause. Understanding this susceptibility may allow the development of treatments that will specifically target the key immune response pathways.
In this study, researchers compared the genomes of Crohn’s patients of European descent, both Jewish and non-Jewish, to those of healthy controls of the same ancestries. More than 1,900 subjects were involved in the analysis. The report appears online in the Oct. 26 issue of Science Express.
The researchers examined more than 300,000 single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs (pronounced “snips”), the variations that occur when a nucleotide, a molecular subunit of DNA, is altered. They found that the frequency of variations in the gene for a receptor of a protein called interleukin-23, or IL-23, was significantly different in people with Crohn’s disease compared with healthy people. After finding the difference in Crohn’s patients, they found it in ulcerative colitis sufferers as well. This genetic variation leads to a susceptibility to the inflammation that characterizes I.B.D.
The IL-23 receptor gene is not the only one thought to be associated with I.B.D., but it seems an especially good candidate. “The IL-23 immune pathway was already implicated in I.B.D., psoriasis, rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis,” said Dr. Richard H. Duerr, the study’s lead author and an associate professor of medicine at the University of Pittsburgh.",2006-11-07 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,colitis

338,"For Bowel Diseases, A New Drug Approach","Each can cause serious side effects. Sulfasalazine, which is related to both aspirin and the sulfa drugs, is only marginally effective when given as the sole drug in patients with active colitis. Once such an attack has been controlled, patients take it to reduce the chances of a further one.
Sulfasalazine has two components: sulfapyridine and 5-ASA (aminosalicylic acid). Sulfasalazine pills work because most of the drug remains intact until it reaches the large bowel. There, harmless bacteria cleave it into the two components. In recent years, scientists have shown that 5-ASA is far more active as an anti-inflammatory agent and that sulfapyridine led to most of the side effects.
Drug companies have made several experimental preparations of 5-ASA on the theory that 5-ASA alone should work while producing few side effects. In practice, however, 5-ASA alone is not effective because it is rapidly absorbed from the small bowel through which it must pass to reach the colon. Thus not enough 5-ASA may reach the diseased areas of the large bowel. Special Coatings
So chemists have coated 5-ASA, and the closely related 4-ASA, with various substances and prepared it in other ways designed to deliver it to the colon. At least six such preparations are marketed or are being tested in the United States, said Dr. Stephen B. Hanauer of the University of Chicago.
One drug, Rowasa, is marketed as an enema by Reid-Rowell of Marietta, Ga., and it is also being tested as coated pills. Others, which are treated to be dissolved according to time or the degree of acidity, include: Pentasa, made by Marion Laboratories of Kansas City, Mo.; Asacol, made by Norwich Eaton of Norwich, N.Y.; Claversal, made by Smith Kline & French of Philadelphia, and 4-ASA, made by Reed & Carnrick of Piscataway, N.J.
Dipentum, or olsalazine, which is made by Pharmacia, and which was recently tested by a team at the Mount Sinai Medical Center, consists of two molecules of 5-ASA linked by a nitrogen bond. The structure allows it to pass unchanged through the small bowel to reach the colon, where bacteria cleave the drug to release the two molecules of 5-ASA. Doctors believe that 5-ASA acts directly on the damaged bowel, blocking key biochemical steps in the inflammatory process. Reactions to Drugs
Up to one-third of those who take sulfasalazine develop nausea, vomiting and allergic reactions. Dr. Samuel Meyers, who headed the team that did the Mount Sinai study, said the hope is that olsalazine and other 5-ASA preparations will be a substitute for many of those who cannot tolerate sulfasalazine.",1988-07-19 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,colitis

341,Researchers Agree Conquest of Cancer Is Distant,"At meetings 15 years ago, for example, doctors spoke about Hodgkins Disease as fatal cancer. Now, with radia tion techniques such as those developed by. Dr. Henry S. Kap lan at Stanford doctors can suc cessfully treat about two‐thirds of patients with the earlier stages of Hodgkins.
What the doctors discussed here was not these gains but how they could combine drugs, surgery or radiation to save the other third and improve results with patients suffering from more advanced forms of Hodg kins Disease.
In the last 20 years, doctors have found more drugs that are successful, at least temporarily, against several types of cancer. For example, a drug called ble omycin, which its Japanese dis coverers and their colleagues have investigated in recent months, interested many scien tists here.
Scientists want to know how they might circumvent the prob lem of drug resistance to its effectiveness, a problem that frustrates many attempts to treat cancer chemically.

Pharmacologists like Dr. Martin Apple of the Univer sity of California Medical School in San Francisco are studying the cell's biochemical and physical properties, includ ing a phenomenon called allo steric mechanism, to under stand better what makes a can cer drug effective. By such studies, they hope to develop a more specific and scientifically rational basis for selecting drugs to treat cancers.
Scientists are now vigorously pursuing the role of viruses in cancer. A virus group called herpes has attracted research ers' attention.

342,"Along the Autism Spectrum, a Path Through Campus Life","Their presence on campuses is also a testament to the tenacity of families and disability advocates who, since the 1990s, when awareness of autism began to mushroom, have pressed for earlier diagnoses and interventions. Much of that battle unfolded in public secondary schools, leading to more services.
Over the last decade, officials at mainstream universities began realizing that growing numbers of spectrum students were being admitted — and, like Mr. Arnold, were foundering.
It was one thing for administrators to authorize accommodations like extra time on tests for students with dyslexia or attention deficit disorder. But how should they bolster students whose behavior was the primary expression of the disability — who could not stop shouting out answers in class and feared dorm showers?
And so the new autism support programs vary in emphasis. Some are based in disability resource centers, while others are in mental health offices, focusing on social skills and anxiety reduction.
“Our mission is to help them transition into the university, be successful here, and then transition out of the university to be successful in adult life,” said Pamela Lubbers, who directs one of the country’s most structured, coordinated programs, with 17 students, at Rutgers-New Brunswick.

(“You think you left your I.D. on the campus bus. What steps will you take to find or replace it?”)

343,The New York Times,"Salt Tablets
Q. Why don't people take salt tablets anymore?
A. Because exercise physiologists have a better understanding of how the body's water loss affects salts in the blood. Salt tablets were thought to help retain water or to restore salts lost through perspiration. Doctors now think excess salt can accelerate dehydration, even leading to blood clots, kidney failure, heart attack and strokes.
Perspiration has a lower concentration of salts than blood, so you lose (and need to replace) more water than salt. ""Sport"" beverages to replace salts are not needed unless you lose more than three quarts of water, or six pounds of weight. For each quart of replacement liquid beyond three, you can add about a half teaspooon of salt, not salt tablets. Large amounts of salt should never be consumed without drinking large quantities of water at the same time.

The committee gathered names from major figures at the university, the faculty senate and student organizations, al umni groups and government and foundation executives. “We also went through the famous candidates, the John Gardner syndrome,” an official said. “Only we did it without John Gardner's name ever coming up.” In all, there were 118 nominees.
Dr. Kibbee, a 49‐year‐old son of the late actor, Guy Kibbee, was first proposed on June 2 by a former faculty member at Carnegie‐Mellon who is close to a high‐ranking administrator at City University. His nomina tion was soon endorsed by Dr. Manning Pattillo Jr., a former president of the Foundation Cen ter, who is a friend of both Dr. Kibbee and of Dr. Frederick H.

346,"Eric Garner, Daniel Pantaleo and Lethal Police Tactics - The New York Times","As early as 1995, a Department of Justice bulletin on “positional asphyxia” quoted the New York Police Department’s guidelines on preventing deaths in custody. “As soon as the subject is handcuffed, get him off his stomach. Turn him on his side or place him in a seated position.”
As Michael Baden, a former chief medical examiner of New York City, told The Times: “Obese people especially, lying face down, prone, are unable to breathe when enough pressure is put on their back. The pressure prevents the diaphragm from going up and down, and he can’t inhale and exhale.”
Which is exactly what Mr. Garner was trying to tell the officers who were on top of him.
Mr. Garner’s death recalls a similar tragedy involving a less familiar name: Robert Ethan Saylor, a 26-year-old man with Down syndrome who was killed last year in a struggle with three off-duty county sheriff’s deputies at a movie theater in Frederick County, Md. Mr. Saylor was overweight. The officers who killed him were just as inept as Officer Pantaleo and his gang, though with one key difference: When they realized that Mr. Saylor was in distress, they tried to save him. Still, their efforts came too late, because mere moments in a facedown arrest can be deadly.
The Garner killing must lead to major changes in policy, particularly in the use of “broken windows” policing — a strategy in which Officer Pantaleo specialized, according to a report in September by WNYC, which found that he had made hundreds of arrests since joining the force in 2007, leading to at least 259 criminal cases, all but a fraction of those involving petty offenses. The department must find a better way to keep communities safe than aggressively hounding the sellers of loose cigarettes.

347,HEALTH: Psychology; Little Fears That Grow With Age Of Child,"''The first question to ask is if the fears a child has are normal for his age,'' said Kathy Sheehan, a psychologist at the University of South Florida College of Medicine, and one of the authors of the article in Psychiatric Annals. ''Most children between 9 and 12 may have fears about school exams, getting hurt or how they look, for instance. But if the fears are so intense they keep the child from doing the things others his age do, then it is a serious emotional problem.'' Small Portion Need Help
A recent random survey in Ontario, Canada, found that among children living in cities, about 6 percent of those from 4 to 11 years old were so fearful or anxious that they might need treatment. Among those 12 to 16, the figure was 2.5 percent. The survey involved 2,621 children. Of the troubled children, however, only 1 in 5 had ever received professional help, said Paul Links, a psychiatrist at McMasters University in Hamilton, Ontario, who did the survey.
In a study at the Harvard Medical School, 25 percent of adults with the pervasive fear agoraphobia reported that the problem began by age 20, most often with a fear of going to school or of being separated from their families. In addition, 4 percent of those with this fear of being in public places recalled having the problem before age 10 and some said they had it to some extent all their lives. The study was published in Comprehensive Psychiatry.
Citing this and other studies, Dr. Sheehan proposed that severe anxiety problems in children be seen as the early stirrings of the same disorders in adults, rather than as unique problems of childhood. Dr. Sheehan wrote the article in Psychiatric Annals with David Sheehan, her husband, and Kailie Shaw of the department of Psychiatry at the South Florida medical school.
The current psychiatric manual for diagnosis lists several varieties of anxiety problems in children, including anxiety about being apart from parents, fearfulness of strangers and being overly worried about potential calamities.

But the newly discovered gene may raise troubling implications for some. In addition to predisposing carriers of either sex to colon cancer, the genetic defect puts women at significantly higher risk for uterine and ovarian cancer. Uterine cancer can be caught and cured early, but no effective mechanism yet exists for spotting ovarian cancer early on, and once it spreads it is highly fatal. In women with the defective gene, the lifetime risk of ovarian cancer is thought to be as high as 15 percent.
""It raises the possibility that one might consider prophylactic surgery,"" that is, removal of the ovaries, said Dr. Collins. Researchers do not yet know whether or at what age such a step might be advised. Women may find themselves in a fearful tussle between the desire to have children, and the concern that if they wait just a bit too long, they will develop cancer.
Scientists are also trying to learn how many other cancers may arise from the genetic defect.
Dr. Judy E. Garber, director of the cancer risk and prevention program at Dana-Farber and an author of the report today, said that given the current state of the insurance industry, those found to have the flaw could be denied insurance.
""Insurance companies could consider this a pre-existing condition, and they don't like to pay for pre-existing conditions,"" she said. ""They also don't like to pay for prevention."" But the frequency of this mutation may prove another spur to wholesale changes in insurance practices.
Of particular joy to proponents of hard-core, undirected research, the new finding turns out to be the human version of a gene well known to microbiologists, who have long been studying it in E coli bacteria and yeast cells. Indeed, Dr. Kolodner and Dr. Fishel were inspired to join the hunt when they read reports last spring, from Dr. Vogelstein and others, of strange strings of mutations cropping up in colon tumors as a result of a gene that had yet to be isolated. That description reminded Dr. Kolodner of the chaos that befalls yeast cells when they lose a gene that directs production of a repair protein called MSH2.
""We had the idea that the human version of the gene might have something to do with human disease,"" he said, ""so we decided to start trying to clone it.""",1993-12-03 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,nonpolyposis
350,Blood Test Devised to Warn Those Prone to Rare Cancer,"About one in 7,000 Americans suffer from the familial polyposis syndrome, and twice that many are thought to be at risk of having the disease. All told, scientists estimate, at least 50,000 people in the United States could immediately benefit from the new test. Researchers, however, emphasized that familial adenomatous polyposis accounted for only about 1 percent of all colon cancer cases and that the new test would not pick up other types of colon malignancies.
Recently scientists announced, to much fanfare, that they had isolated the gene for another, far more common form of colon cancer, called hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer. A blood test for that malignancy, which accounts for up to 15 percent of all colon cancers, may also be available within a few months.
Dr. Kenneth W. Kinzler and Dr. Steven M. Powell of the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine Center in Baltimore and their colleagues report on the diagnostic method in today's issue of The New England Journal of Medicine. ""I think this is a strong example of how basic science is being rapidly translated into tools with bedside potential,"" Dr. Kinzler said. ""We can do the whole assay in a test tube in just a matter of hours.""
The test is not foolproof. In the new study, the scientists identified mutant proteins in 54 of 62 patients known to be afflicted with familial polyposis, a success rate of 87 percent. But the researchers said the figure would be higher in many situations, particularly when there are others in the family with the trait. In such cases the results of the tests on the family members can be compared against each other. But Dr. Kinzer said people with no hereditary link who have unusually high numbers of polyps might also wish to be tested to see if they bear the trait. Drugs Being Developed

351,Q & A,"Genetic Risk of Cancer
Q. What cancers are known to be inherited?
A. ''There is much more sporadic cancer than there is inherited cancer,'' said Dr. Dawn Willis, a scientific program director with the American Cancer Society. ''Only when two first-degree relatives like a mother, father, sister or brother have the same cancer do you start looking for a genetic link.
''Even within the kinds of cancer where such a link is known, the genetically linked ones are a small subset. For example, there are at least two kinds of breast cancer that have a strong genetic link, but that is less than 5 percent of all breast cancers. The same genes, BRCA1 and BRCA2, are involved in ovarian cancer, and there the link is stronger, accounting for perhaps 8 percent of ovarian cancer over all, but it is a much rarer disease.''
In colon cancer, familial adenomatous polyposis is very strongly associated with the FAP gene, but it is a rare defect. Hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer involves a defect of the DNA repair gene and is found in 10 percent to 12 percent of colon cancers. Other rare, inherited cancers include childhood thyroid cancer and retinoblastoma, an eye malignancy.
''There are probably genetic links in other diseases, but they probably involve not a single gene but multiple mutations,'' she said. C. CLAIBORNE RAY",2002-04-09 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,nonpolyposis
352,A Cancer Gene Makes Colon Removal an Option,"People with genes that dramatically increase their risk of one form of colorectal cancer should have careful medical surveillance and may, in some circumstances, want to consider having their healthy colons removed as a pre-emptive measure, a medical panel reports.
The panel, the Cancer Genetics Study Consortium, made up of 11 doctors and other health professionals, stopped short of actually recommending such surgery, saying evidence was lacking to indicate its benefits. It said only that colon removal can be offered as an option to these patients. Its conclusions are being published in Wednesday's issue of The Journal of the American Medical Association.
People with such genes should definitely have a colonoscopy every one to three years, starting at 20 to 25 years of age, the task force said. In a colonoscopy, a flexible tube is inserted deep into the colon and lets the doctor see polyps or cancer.

Their approach avoids a biological ''cover-up'' that can foil efforts to survey particular genes for mutations.
The work is presented in today's issue of the journal Nature by a team including Dr. Bert Vogelstein of the Johns Hopkins Oncology Center in Baltimore and the Howard Hughes Medical Institute.

354,Surviving Colon Cancer Is Tied to Family History of It,"People with a family history of colon cancer carry the emotional burden of knowing they have twice the risk of developing the disease themselves. But a new study may ease some of their anxiety. Patients with a family history of colon cancer, the researchers found, are also more likely to survive it.
The surprising paradox, being published Wednesday in The Journal of the American Medical Association, may ultimately steer researchers toward new treatments and a better understanding of the disease.
An estimated 153,000 cases of colon and rectal cancer will be diagnosed in the United States in 2008, according to the American Cancer Society, and about 50,000 people will die of it. Studies of twins show that about 35 percent of colon cancers are inherited, and about 11 percent of patients have at least two close relatives with the disease.

355,SCIENTIST AT WORK: Richard D. Kolodner; An Amazing Leap From Yeast Genes To Human Cancer,"Arriving at Harvard, Dr. Kolodner said, ""was like coming to Mars,"" because it was so large, elitist and unfriendly compared with Irvine. ""Harvard Medical School is a very big place and very intense,"" Dr. Kolodner said. ""It's one of the most intense places I've ever been.""
He added: ""There is always someone here who is really smart and doing great stuff. The standards here are remarkably high. Many, myself included, tended to be at the top of their institutions and then they come here and they're much more ordinary than they used to be. It's quite daunting, to be sure.""
It made for a certain insecurity. ""There are some who will never let you forget that they are smarter than you are,"" Dr. Kolodner said. On the other hand, he added, many of even the best and busiest of the medical school's scientists always had time to talk to him and help him with his experiments. Seeking a Niche
So Dr. Kolodner settled in, studying how bacterial DNA copies itself when a cell is getting ready to divide. He spent a lot of time just learning to purify the various enzymes that take part in this intricate process. After three years, he was ready to strike out on his own. He became an assistant professor at Dana-Farber and decided to choose a different research area, since he did not feel he could make a distinctive mark in the crowded field of DNA replication.
Instead, he said, he found what seemed to be ""a wide open field,"" DNA recombination, a reshuffling of genes that sometimes occurs when cells divide. Recombination was poorly understood and Dr. Kolodner decided to focus on how DNA molecules break and rejoin and correct errors in their genetic code before copying themselves when a cell divides.
Changing fields is a perilous step for a researcher since he or she must learn a new subject and master new techniques.
""I threw out my reagents and started over again,"" Dr. Kolodner said. ""I was scared to death. When you have your own lab, it's really wonderful. It's all yours for the first time. You can do whatever you want. Then you look around, and the walls are bare.""",1994-05-03 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,nonpolyposis
356,Disclosure of How a Gene Causes Breast Cancer,"Scientists at the University of North Carolina have made an important discovery about how defects in one of the two breast cancer genes, BRCA1, raise the risk of the disease: They leave cells without the normal ability to correct certain mistakes that commonly occur in their genetic machinery.
The scientists and researchers say the finding has potentially important clinical implications for people known to carry the defective gene. On the one hand, it could result in more effective treatments for hereditary breast cancer. It could also lead to a test that would predict which of the women and men who carry the defective gene are most likely to develop cancer.
On the other hand, the new understanding raises questions about the safety of starting at a young age to do regular mammograms in women who inherit the defective gene.
The new information, reported in today's issue of the journal Science, will add to the understanding of how cancer starts and what might be done to prevent it. The lead author of the study, Lori C. Gowen, a graduate student, said, ''This is the first direct evidence of a function for this tumor-suppressor gene, and it helps to explain how the gene may be involved in cancer.''",1998-08-14 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,nonpolyposis
357,Competing Research Teams Find New Colon Cancer Clue,"Together, the two mutator genes are thought to be behind up to 95 percent of all cases of hereditary colon cancers, which make up about 20 percent of the 160,000 cases of colon cancer diagnosed in the United States each year. Scientists also have evidence that the genes are responsible for many nonheriditary cases of colon cancer, as well as some malignancies of the ovaries, uterus and other organs. The researchers estimate that about one million Americans carry one of the two genetic defects with no awareness of the risk.
Once identified in a test as carrying one of the genes, people could be counseled to have yearly colonoscopic examinations able to detect and excise tiny polyps before the growths turn malignant. Carriers might also change their habits, shunning fatty foods in favor of high-fiber ones, exercising more and taking other steps known to reduce the risk of colon cancer.
By catching colon cancer at the earliest possible stage, researchers hope to make a significant dent in the number of fatalities from the disease. Right now, about 64,000 people a year die of the disease, making it the second greatest cause of death by cancer after lung tumors. Test to Be Limited
But researchers emphasized that the blood test is likely to be limited for the near future to those known to come from a family with an obvious history of colon cancer, a syndrome formally called hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer. To fall in this category, a person must have at least two close relatives who have been afflicted with colon cancer, one of them before the age of 50. Scientists say the development of an effective test for the broader public will require even greater ingenuity and hard work.
""If you consider all the people who have a mutation in one of these genes, along with their extended families, we're talking about a few million people who, in the best of all possible worlds, we'd want to test,"" said Dr. Bert Vogelstein of the Johns Hopkins Oncology Center in Baltimore, Md., a leader of one of the research teams.",1994-03-17 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,nonpolyposis
358,PERSONAL HEALTH; Detecting Colon Cancer When It Is Curable,"For some reason, women tend to think of colorectal cancer as a man's disease, and even those women who regularly have mammograms and Pap smears tend to ignore their colons. But the disease shows no sex discrimination; if anything, it hits women slightly harder than men. This year about 67,000 women -- 4,600 more women than men -- will be found to have colorectal cancer, and 28,800 women -- 1,000 more women than men -- will die of this disease. And while overall death rates from colorectal cancer have been dropping in this country, among African-Americans they have risen by 9 percent in the last 20 years.
A Choice of Tests
Since 1986 the incidence of colorectal cancer has been declining by more than 1 percent a year. Researchers at the University of Illinois at Chicago recently attributed this decline to an increased use of screening tests and to the removal of precancerous polyps found as a result. Their study indicated that changes in diet and life style have played only a minor role in the decline. But a survey conducted in 1997 among 52,754 men and women ages 50 and older by the Federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention revealed that only a minority of Americans in that age group have ever taken advantage of the available screening tests.
There are many reasons why such life-saving measures are not better used: the preparation is off-putting, there is often discomfort and embarrassment, and the screening costs money. Insurance rarely covers the cost of the most comprehensive tests when used as screening tools. Only those people who already have suspicious symptoms of cancer would be covered.
The simplest and cheapest of the tests -- a digital rectal exam by the doctor and a self-test for hidden blood in the feces -- are also, unfortunately, the least accurate, although the occult blood test can reduce the risk of dying from colon cancer by more than 33 percent, according to the Harvard Center for Cancer Prevention. The occult blood test can help detect a problem because colorectal cancers and precancerous polyps often -- but not always -- bleed slightly, depositing tiny amounts of blood on the surface of bowel movements.
The most commonly used version, Hemoccult II, involves smearing feces on test cards for three consecutive days, then mailing the cards for chemical analysis. For two days before the test and during the three test days you are advised to avoid certain foods and drugs that may distort the results. Drugs like aspirin, ibuprofen and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories as well as iron, reserpine and persantine can cause slight gastrointestinal bleeding and should not be taken. Doses of vitamin C greater than 250 milligrams, which can mask the presence of blood, should also be avoided. You may also be told to refrain from consuming certain foods and not to have any dental work done until after the test.",1999-09-28 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,nonpolyposis

The overriding conclusion to our work is that “one size does not fit all”; local conditions and a country’s political, economic and social development determine what’s necessary to provide women surgery that relieves their incontinence.
While community action that produces support for government programs is certainly ideal, in many countries with extremely weak central governments this is unrealistic. In the Democratic Republic of Congo and Somaliland, for instance, outside resources are vital to providing treatment.

“My sister-in-law said, ‘You’re too smelly; people don’t want to come to our house,’” Marima recalled, crying softly. She stopped eating solid food so that she would leak less feces, and for four months she lay unmoving on the floor and survived on tea and camel milk.
Marima dropped to just 55 pounds. She had bed sores on her buttocks and ulcers on her thighs and genitals from her constantly seeping urine. At 17, she waited to die.
“People said that God had cursed me,” Marima said. “I felt it was better to die than to have this problem.”
Then a family member took her to a branch of Hamlin Fistula Ethiopia, a nonprofit that treats fistulas. Today she is walking again, has recovered weight, and the hole with her rectum has been repaired. Dr. Fekade Ayenachew, the medical director, said he was still figuring out how best to deal with the leaking urine.
Fistulas used to be common in the West, and there was a fistula hospital in Manhattan on the site of what is now the Waldorf Astoria hotel. But once C-sections became available, they largely disappeared.

361,Women With Fistula,"To the Editor:
Through columns like “Where Young Women Find Healing and Hope” (July 14), Nicholas D. Kristof has done a huge service to raise awareness about fistula, a devastating childbirth injury. But Mr. Kristof’s portrayal of women with fistula as “miserable,” “downcast” and “ashamed” before treatment masks the more important story of the strength and resilience that many of these women muster to manage their lives.
My experience in East Africa has shown me that depicting women with fistula as helpless may move hearts, but undermines their dignity.
The financial contributions of Times readers and the work of Western doctors have no doubt made a difference. But that does not amount to an effective strategy. We would better advance the cause by addressing the more difficult challenge of how governments, health workers and activists can design and deliver health systems that work for women.

The comments of Maggie Bangser, a founding director of the Women’s Dignity Project (letter, July 18), in response to Nicholas D. Kristof’s July 14 column about obstetric fistula, make the valid point that the ultimate solution to these catastrophic complications of childbirth is the creation of effective medical delivery systems that meet women’s reproductive health care needs.
That is precisely the reason the Danja Fistula Center, built by the Worldwide Fistula Fund, has incorporated anthropological field research, prenatal care, public health outreach, case identification, and social rehabilitation and job skills programs into its comprehensive program for women with obstetric fistulas in Niger.

The agency also believes that prevention can significantly reduce the number of cases.
Our maternal health programs focus on access to a skilled birth attendant for all women, early identification of prolonged and obstructed labor, and timely treatment of this complication so that fistula does not occur.

364,Fighting fistula - Editorials & Commentary - International Herald Tribune,"There are three things everyone should know about fistula. First, it is a terrible childbirth injury, a hole in the birth canal that leaves women incontinent and ashamed. Second, most of its victims are young, poor, malnourished women living in remote areas of Africa and Asia. Many of them are teenage girls, many of them married, many of them too young to be pregnant in the first place. And third, nine out of ten simple fistulas can be repaired.
About one in eight pregnancies end in some sort of complication. Pregnant women need a backup within reach, especially if they deliver at home. The UN Population Fund and Britain's Department for International Development are helping governments in developing countries provide basic health services, including training medical teams in fistula repair, as part of a wider global effort to improve maternal health.
But why are young teenage girls getting pregnant at all? Why are older women taking the risk of yet another pregnancy when their bodies are weakened by childbirth, anemia and malnutrition? The answer is: They may have little choice.
Despite years of effort, most women in Africa and many in Asia do not yet have access to family planning. Older men marry young girls who have no control over their bodies. One result is that more than two million women today are living with fistula and its consequences. There may be another 50,000 to 100,000 new cases every year.",2006-07-14 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,fistula
365,"After a Devastating Birth Injury Called a Fistula, Hope","The women filled most of Ward 2, a long, one-story building with a cement floor and two rows of closely spaced beds against opposite walls. All had suffered from obstructed labor, meaning that their babies were too big or in the wrong position to pass through the birth canal. If prolonged, obstructed labor often kills the baby, which may then soften enough to fit through the pelvis, so that the mother delivers a corpse.
Obstructed labor can kill the mother, too, or crush her bladder, uterus and vagina between her pelvic bones and the baby’s skull. The injured tissue dies, leaving a fistula: a hole that lets urine stream out constantly through the vagina. In some cases, the rectum is damaged and stool leaks out. Some women also have nerve damage in the legs.
One of the most striking things about the women in Ward 2 was how small they were. Many stood barely five feet tall, with slight frames and narrow hips, which may have contributed to their problems. Girls not fully grown, or women stunted by malnutrition, often have small pelvises that make them prone to obstructed labor.
The women wore kangas, bolts of cloth wrapped into skirts, in bright prints that stood out against the ward’s drab, chipping paint. Under the skirts, some had kangas bunched between their legs to absorb urine.
Not even a curtain separated the beds. An occasional hot breeze blew in through the screened windows. Flies buzzed, and a cat with one kitten loitered in the doorway. Outside, kangas that had been washed by patients or their families were draped over bushes and clotheslines and patches of grass, drying in the sun.

He is a three-time Think Like a Doctor winner whose last win was just last month. If this keeps up, I’m afraid that I’m going to have to institute the rule from the radio quiz show “Whad’ya Know?”: “Listeners who have won recently should sit on their hands and let someone else have a chance for a change.” Still, Dr. Budhram – impressive achievement! Well done!
About the Diagnosis
An arteriovenous fistula is an abnormal connection between the high-pressure arterial system – the thick muscular blood vessels that carry blood forcefully pumped out by the heart to provide oxygen to the rest of the body — and the low-pressure venous system, made up of the thinner, more elastic vessels through which the blood is pushed back into the heart. Normally, blood flows from the heart into arteries and then to tiny capillaries, where the circulation slows and the nutrients and oxygen can move into the tissues. From there, the blood flows into the veins, where it is pushed onward, back to the heart.
AV fistulas occur most commonly in the legs but can occur anywhere in the body — including, very rarely, the brain. Once these abnormal connections form, they cause two immediate problems.
First, the arterial blood is diverted from its normal pathway, and so the downstream tissues can be injured by the loss of expected blood flow. Fortunately, our bodies are well protected against this kind of loss and can quickly grow new vessels, called collaterals, that carry blood around the bypass to the starving tissues beyond.
The second problem is what happens to the more delicate veins when they are hit with the high-pressure blood flow from the heart. Once the abnormal connection forms, the less muscular veins are damaged and, over time, become thickened and scarred and eventually are blocked completely.",2016-11-04 21:51:17,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,fistula

369,ANOREXIA: IT'S NOT A NEW DISEASE,"Before the 1970's, most people had never heard of anorexia nervosa. Since then this mysterious and frightening eating disorder, which afflicts primarily teen-age girls and young women who diet to the point of near starvation, has received a great deal of attention, creating the impression that it is a new phenomenon.
Actually, anorexia nervosa is known to have existed for more than a century. ''Most people think it is a strictly modern disease, but it was named and identified in the 1870's,'' said Joan Jacobs Brumberg, an assistant professor of history at Cornell University who is writing a book on the social and cultural history of the disorder. Dr. Brumberg began researching her book, ''Fasting Girls: The Emergence of Anorexia Nervosa,'' in 1982, when she was a fellow at the Charles Warren Center for Studies in American History at Harvard University. She said she expects it to be published next year.
''Anorexia is lack of appetite, and anorexia nervosa is lack of appetite from nervous causes,'' she said. ''It was widely regarded as a form of hysteria. In the 19th century, doctors did not find anorexia nervosa uncommon. Many agreed they had seen it.'' The disorder was given its name in 1873 by a British physician, Sir William Withey Gull, who took care of Queen Victoria and her family. Physicians in the United States and France also reported seeing anorexia nervosa around the same time.
Today anorexia nervosa affects young women in all strata of society, but in the Victorian era it was an ailment of the middle and upper-middle classes. ''Anorexia is related to the larger history of the rise of the middle class,'' said Dr. Brumberg, who is the director of women's studies at Cornell. ''In the 19th century, there was a certain emotional and material privileging of girls. In a culture of affluence, food and eating become very important to people.''",1985-12-08 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,anorexia

“This is an important paper,” said Antonio Rangel, a professor of neuroscience, behavioral biology and economics at the California Institute of Technology who was not involved in the study.
The study’s findings, Dr. Rangel said, were “consistent with the idea that the habitual system may be in control over the behavior of the anorexic much more than in the general population.”
B. Timothy Walsh, the senior author of the report, said the study grew out of a theoretical paper he published in 2013. In that paper, he proposed that for women who are vulnerable to anorexia, weight loss initially serves as a reward, eliciting compliments, relieving anxiety and increasing self-esteem. Over time, though, the pairing of dieting with a reward — weight loss — may result in the act of dieting itself becoming rewarding.
This theory, said Dr. Walsh, a professor of psychiatry at the psychiatric institute at Columbia, might shed light on why treatment is more successful the earlier it is offered and less successful the longer the illness has been established. He predicted in the paper that as an anorexic patient’s dieting became more habitual, the dorsal striatum would become more involved.
“It helps to explain why treatments we expect to work, like antidepressants and cognitive therapy, don’t work very well,” Dr. Walsh said. “Habits have to be replaced with another behavior.”
For example, he said, one strategy might be to get the patient to look at entrees as well as at the salad bar, or to switch to eating with the left hand, as a reminder to think about eating different foods.",2015-10-12 15:00:50,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,anorexia
371,When Anorexics Grow Up,"But in 2003, one-third of inpatient admissions to a specialized eating disorders treatment center were for people over age 30, according to the National Eating Disorders Association. In an online survey published in the International Journal of Eating Disorders, 13 percent of women over age 50 were found to have eating disorder symptoms. And many older sufferers of eating disorders, some of whom have been battling the disorder since they were young, feel shame at having a “teenager’s problem” and are reluctant to get help.
After decades of therapy — of great days and good years, relapses and starting over from scratch — I realize there’s an ending these movies fail to capture. Some of us are never going to be fully cured.
That doesn’t mean we return to our anorexia rock bottom.
For me, that was when I was 20 and had become so ill that heart palpitations kept me up at night. It was when I walked down Bayswater Road so weak from hunger that traffic sounds and accents blend into a single white noise loop. It was when two photographers stopped me on the same afternoon to ask if I wanted to model while my chest rattled from walking pneumonia.
Living with eating disorder thinking means actively ignoring a voice in my head that tells me it’s dangerous to have a favorite restaurant (Tanoreen in Brooklyn) or to lick my lips while savoring sumac shredded chicken. It’s forcing myself to use positive adjectives to describe my 5-year-old’s mac and cheese after she proclaims it’s the “best thing ever.” It’s never being able to engage in conversations with other women — and, boy are there many — about losing weight or trying out a fad diet. And it’s feeling their eyes on me when I won’t join in the ritual of bashing my own thighs.
They suspect it’s because I think I’m better than everyone else; I know it’s because my weak mind can’t afford dabbling in this sport.
I feel anxiety every time I realize my body is going to change as I age, with or without my consent, whether I weigh 89 pounds or 289 pounds. I don’t trust the body and fear the ways it can turn on you. At an early age I decided that the only way to stall death or pain, or both, is to wield a lion tamer’s whip and keep cracking at the body, change after change.
For me, change is as much an enemy as weight gain and the body itself. Puberty is one of the most frequently discussed risk periods for the development of eating disorders. The frustration I have with the focus on puberty and eating disorders is that it doesn’t address the fact that every stage of life for a person with an eating disorder presents enormous changes.",2018-01-11 11:00:01,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,anorexia
372,ANOREXIA: NOT JUST A DISEASE OF THE YOUNG,"Neither the cause nor the cure for the ailments are understood and there is more speculation than verified fact on all aspects of the conditions. Some experts, for example, believe that when the disorders develop in older people they are part of more severe mental illness; others disagree.
There is also disagreement about which disorder strikes older women more often, though most authorities say that older bulimics outnumber anorexics in their age category. There is agreement that, no matter what the condition, the older the individual the more tenacious it will be.
''When it occurs later, it tends to be more severe,'' said Estelle Miller, a psychotherapist and executive director of the American Anorexia/Bulimia Association, a clearinghouse in Teaneck, N.J., that has 10 chapters. ''With adolescents, there is a better chance that, with time, they will accept themselves and get over it.''
Most cases of adult anorexia or bulimia, it is believed, simply represent the continuation of behavior begun decades earlier and profoundly ingrained. ''We see women in their 40's who have been binging and vomiting almost daily for 15 to 20 years,'' said Dr. David Herzog, director of the Eating Disorders Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital and associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School. ''Most of them are married,'' he said, ''and their spouses, even those who are physicians, are unaware of their practices. They are very proficient in concealment.''
When onset does occur after the age of 30, it is usually preceded by an traumatic life event. In some cases, pregnancy is the trigger. Dr. Hilde Bruch, professor emeritus in the department of psychiatry, Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, who saw her first anorexic patient 40 years ago, recalled seeing several women ''who could not stand the idea of having a large abdomen and actually lost weight by starving during pregnancy. In some instances, morning sickness turned into bulimia,'' she said. ''Fortunately the babies were born healthy.'' Reasons for Late Onset
Late onset may also be related to a transition in work, a divorce or the end of a serious relationship, according to Dr. Craig Johnson, director of the Eating Disorders Program at Michael Reese Medical Center in Chicago. ''When there is a romantic disruption, one of the things women often do is to go on a diet, and some diets are so restrictive that followers become vulnerable to binge eating in order to make up for the difference between calorie expenditure and calorie intake.'' In addition, ''When someone leaves, you want to regain control of your life and one way to do that is to control your body,'' he said.",1983-07-18 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,anorexia
373,The New York Times,"Anorexia is 10 times as common in women as in men, and a new study suggests that female sex hormones in the womb may play a part.
Researchers used the Swedish twin registry to study 4,226 pairs of female twins, 3,451 pairs of male twins and 4,478 pairs of opposite-sex twins, all born from 1935 to 1958. They found 51 cases of anorexia among the female twins, 3 among the male twins and 36 among the opposite-sex pairs. The study was published in the December issue of The Archives of General Psychiatry.

As expected, the risk of anorexia in female twins was higher than in male twins. But in the opposite-sex twins, 16 anorexia cases, almost half, were in males. In other words, the male member of a male-female twin pair had a risk for anorexia statistically no different from the risk among females.",2007-12-11 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,anorexia
374,A Debate Over Bulimia and Abuse,"WHILE an earlier generation of therapists was criticized for minimizing the lasting psychological impact of their patients' childhood traumas, a current crop of therapists is coming under attack for telling patients that their symptoms indicate they must have suffered a childhood trauma, which they have buried.
If the patient cannot come up with such a memory, these therapists help them out with methods that include hypnosis, visualization and even sodium amytal, the so-called ""truth serum,"" actually a short-acting barbiturate that induces an intoxication during which people talk with fewer inhibitions. While no on can say how common these practices are, such methods are ""a sure-fire way to implant false memories,"" said Dr. Elizabeth Loftus, an expert on memory at the University of Washington.
Among the symptoms often considered by these therapists to be a sign that a person was sexually abused in childhood is bulimia. In the recent California case in which Gary Ramona was awarded $500,000 after a jury found that psychotherapists had talked his adult daughter into falsely remembering childhood sexual abuse, bulimia was the problem for which she had sought treatment. In that case, before setting out to find the daughter's repressed memory of sexual abuse through the use of sodium amytal, the daughter's psychiatrist had told her that 70 to 80 percent of bulimics have been sexually abused.
Those figures are disputed, however, by an article in the current issue of The American Journal of Psychiatry reporting that women suffering from bulimia show no higher rates of childhood sexual abuse (ranging from fondling to intercourse), than do women in the general population.",1994-05-31 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,bulimia
375,Bulimics More Apt to Binge in Morning and When Alone,"Everyone craves a bag of potato chips, a bowl of chocolate ice cream or a juicy steak from time to time. But for people with bulimia nervosa, these cravings can trigger a cascade of reactions that culminate in a binge of thousands of calories, researchers report.
In a study of 15 bulimic women, investigators found that eating alone, giving in to a food craving, and eating in the morning increased the risk that a meal or snack developed into a binge.
Succumbing to a craving while alone was more likely to occur in the morning. A nighttime craving was less likely to result in a binge, the report indicates.
``The most important (and novel) finding is that binges are more likely to occur in the context of a combination of environmental and food-related variables,'' according to Dr. Anne Waters, from the University of Southampton in the UK, and colleagues.",2001-01-19 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,bulimia
376,Searching for a New Way to Treat Bulimia,"WHETHER it was prompted by the pressures of growing up in an upper middle-class suburb, or whether it was genetic or just bad luck, somewhere along the line a 41-year old Greenwich woman lost the ability to deal with stress, feelings and problems.
Instead, she found comfort in food, using binge eating and purging by vomiting to relieve stress. Like an estimated 1 to 2 percent of women between the ages of 16 and 35 in the United States, she became bulimic.
''I've struggled with it off and on since college,'' said the woman, who requested anonymity. ''I don't think I've ever been free of the desire for more than a few months at a time in all my adult life.''
Now the woman is taking part in a three- to four-year study in Greenwich that doctors hope will lead to an alternative, and more accessible, way to treat the disorder. The study is being financed by the National Institute of Health, which issued a grant of more than $500,000 in 1997. If the new treatments are found to be effective, they could provide an alternative to current methods, which require treatment by psychologists or psychiatrists.",1999-06-06 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,bulimia
377,Study Links Bulimia to Chemical Malfunction in the Brain,"A new study adds to evidence that the eating disorder bulimia springs at least in part from a chemical malfunction in the brain and not merely from an excessive desire to be thin, researchers say.
In the study, released yesterday, women who had suffered from bulimia and recovered were more affected psychologically than other women by being deprived of tryptophan, which plays an indirect role in appetite regulation, researchers found.
Tryptophan is an amino acid that occurs naturally in many foods and is used by the body to make serotonin, a mood- and appetite-regulating chemical in the brain.
Tryptophan, like that used in the study, is not available in the United States. L-tryptophan supplements were withdrawn from the market in 1990 after 36 people died and many others became ill after taking them.",1999-02-16 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,bulimia
378,Former deputy leader of Britain says he struggled with bulimia,"LONDON — John Prescott, the former deputy prime minister of Britain known for his tough-guy image, said Sunday that he had secretly struggled with bulimia for decades.
Prescott, 69, wrote in The Sunday Times that he used to gorge on vast amounts of food and then force himself to vomit.
""It's such a strange thing for someone like me to confess to,"" Prescott wrote. ""People normally associate it with young women, anorexic girls, models trying to keep their weight down, or women in stressful situations, like Princess Diana.""
Outside of Britain, Prescott is perhaps best known for punching a heckler in the jaw after being hit by an egg during the 2001 election campaign. Images of the punch were broadcast around the world.",2008-04-20 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,bulimia
379,A Mother Grieves by Making a Film About Bulimia,"The film, called “Someday Melissa” and now in the editing stages, has become for Ms. Avrin salve, distraction and cause — a way to get the word out to other families grappling with eating disorders that they are not alone; to sound the alarm that eating disorders have the highest mortality rate of any mental illness; to help make sense of the senseless event that was losing her teenage daughter.
Image FAMILY Above, Melissa Avrin with her brother, Andrew, at Thanksgiving time in Utah in 2007.
“I kept saying, ‘This is an amazing way for me to channel my grief,’ ” Ms. Avrin said. “But it also allowed me to put off grieving.”
Ms. Avrin, 56, got the idea for the film from one of Melissa’s therapists, Danna Markson, who introduced her to Jeffrey Cobelli, 27, a filmmaker. Over the last several months of working on the project, Ms. Avrin has come to know more than she ever intended to about eating disorders — how their seriousness has been underestimated, their treatment underinsured, their deaths underreported.
The process hasn’t been easy, and some, like her ex-husband, initially questioned the impulse to do it at all. Melissa’s best friend since first grade, Nicole Kendrick, who also suffers from an eating disorder, said she was incredulous when she first learned that Ms. Avrin was making the film. “I thought she was crazy,” Ms. Kendrick said. “I guess I didn’t realize how deep a mother’s love can run.”
But Ms. Avrin said that making the film has been easier than doing nothing at all. “I’ve never once thought this was more than I could bear,” she said, in an interview at her home in Totowa, N.J. “If anything, the more I continue, the more I know it’s the right thing to do.”
The difficulty of reliving her daughter’s decline has been mitigated by the public response. “Sometimes I think: ‘I’m a suburban mom. Who am I to think I could make a difference in the world?’ ” Ms. Avrin said. “But then I read the messages that keep coming in from people I know and people I don’t know who say Melissa’s story has motivated them to fight one more day.”",2010-04-21 17:41:04,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,bulimia
380,Drugs Win Support As a Bulimia Treatment,"THE use of drugs to treat bulimia is gaining increasing acceptance as an alternative to psychotherapy, according to doctors who specialize in the eating disorder.
The shift, however, has been cautious. Some psychotherapists remain skeptical of the long-term value of medication, saying it fails to deal with underlying psychological issues. And the most recent evidence indicates that while antidepressant drugs can help some bulimics quickly reduce binge eating and purging, their value may be limited to use as a supplement to psychotherapy.
Until five years ago, the idea of treating bulimia with antidepressants was considered ''ridiculous'' because the ailment was considered a psychological not a biological problem, said Dr. Timothy Walsh of the New York State Psychiatric Institute in Manhattan. However, at least 10 studies have been published since 1983 with ''almost unanimously positive'' results, he said. Long-Term Studies
Now the research has reached a turning point; having determined that drugs can help in the short term, scientists are beginning to study long-term effects. In addition, they are trying to pin down who might be helped and how it might be used in conjunction with traditional therapy.",1988-03-22 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,bulimia
381,AN EATING DISORDER OF BINGES AND PURGES REPORTED,"Dr. Anita Siegman of the University of Southern California sees the eating disorder in part as growing out of the stress of trying to be perfect. ''Eating becomes a form of release, the only thing they can completely control,'' she remarked. ''Food temporarily relieves the anger and depression most of these women feel.''
Though it may seem hard to believe, Dr. Richard Pyle of the University of Minnesota Hospitals and Clinics says that guilt-ridden victims are so careful to hide their disorder that those who live with them may not know it exists. One woman managed to keep her daily binges secret from her husband of 20 years.
In its most severe form, the syndrome precludes a normal social and working life. ''So many hours are spent eating and vomiting that nearly all social contact is cut off,'' Dr. Pyle said. ''Many patients said all they did was work, sleep and binge.''
The disorder can also have potentially serious, and possibly fatal, medical complications. Most commonly, victims develop severe tooth decay from destruction of the tooth enamel by acidic vomitus. One bulimic patient sought help only after all her teeth had been capped twice, at a cost of $20,000. Other side effects include a constant sore throat, esophageal inflammation, swollen glands near the cheeks, liver damage, nutrient deficiencies and, in those who use laxatives, rectal bleeding. Life-threatening complications include rupture of the stomach and disruption of the body's electrolyte and fluid balance, which can cause heart rhythm abnormalities.
Bulimia is related to, but distinct from, another eating disorder, anorexia nervosa, the self-induced ''starvation disease'' which is also now being seen in increasing numbers of young people. Whereas most bulimics are at or near a normal weight for their height, anorexics drop 25 percent or more below normal weight. About half of anorexics periodically experience binge-and-purge behavior, and this group is considered hardest to treat. Bulimics and anorexics share a morbid fear of weight gain and a fear of losing control over their eating. Binges in Obese People
Going on binges without purging is often found among obese people. However, according to Dr. Susan Wooley of the department of psychiatry at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center, the obese tend to consume far less food in a binge than do bulimia patients.
Whereas an obese person might count a half a pizza and two brownies as a binge, a typical binge for a bulimic may begin with two packages of cookies and a loaf of bread, a gallon of milk and a half gallon of ice cream and conclude with a basket of fried chicken, fistfuls of candy and pastries.",1981-10-20 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,bulimia
382,Christine Quinn Opens Up About Her Struggles Against Bulimia and Alcoholism,"In college, her life was split in two. She was a social butterfly and a joker who sometimes dressed in a chicken suit to play the school’s mascot, the Bantam, at football games, and a prominent political activist, protesting recruitment on campus for the Central Intelligence Agency and apartheid in South Africa. At the same time, she struggled with waves of sadness. She would go to class and dutifully take down what the professor said, then go back to her room and find her notes incomprehensible. She would get drunk at parties and campus bars. She developed a crush on an older female student, but she tried to ignore her feelings.
Between political meetings and parties, she would sneak into the dorm bathroom, make sure no one was there and throw up. For all the activity around her, there were times of intense loneliness.
“What you’re doing is not something you do with other people,” she said of bingeing and purging, “so you have to kind of find moments or structure moments when you’re by yourself. And the bad thing about isolation is I think it fuels more isolation.”
After graduation, Ms. Quinn moved to Manhattan, where she got a job as a housing organizer and shared a tiny one-bedroom walk-up in Yorkville with a high school friend. She met Thomas K. Duane at a tenant rally, and when he ran for the Council as one of the first openly gay candidates, she became his campaign manager.
The two spent long hours together on the campaign trail, and she came out to Mr. Duane as a lesbian and began dating a woman with whom she would have a seven-year relationship.
Months later, after Mr. Duane had won his election, the subject of eating disorders came up in conversation. Ms. Quinn seized the opening and told him of her problem. Mr. Duane, a recovering alcoholic, urged her to go to rehabilitation, which she did, for 28 days in August 1992.
“It was the first significant time in my life that I had asked for help, and I think up until that point in my life I associated asking for help with defeat,” she said.",2013-05-14 06:01:17,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,bulimia

The study, which looked at patients taking any of four antipsychotic drugs, examined all cases of pancreatitis that were reported to the Food and Drug Administration or written up in medical journals between January 1981 and February 2002. It found that more cases were associated with three newer drugs than with an older generation drug.
Of the 192 cases of pancreatitis the researchers found, 72 occurred in patients taking Clozaril, made by Novartis, 62 in patients taking Zyprexa, made by Eli Lilly, and 31 in patients taking Risperdal, made by Jannsen Pharmaceutica.

386,"The Pancreas, a Many-Faceted Gland","Researchers are discovering that the pancreas helps mediate much of the appetite-related cross talk between the brain and the gastrointestinal tract, the streams of chemical signals that say, I’m starving down here, how about some dinner, or, enough already, step away from that dessert cart and no one will be hurt. By better understanding the precise role of the pancreas in conveying sensations of hunger or satiety, suggested Rodger A. Liddle of Duke University Medical School, we may find new ways to combat obesity.
Other researchers are intrigued by the pancreas’s ability to shield itself from harm, to churn out huge quantities of enzymes that can rapidly reduce a cheeseburger and fries to so many particles of amino acids, carbohydrates and fats, without digesting its own tissue in the process. They suspect that the organ’s set of self-protective mechanisms has a terrible downside, and helps explain why pancreatic cancer can be so difficult to treat  insights that are just beginning to offer hope in the fight against one of the most lethal of all malignancies.
If you’ve been remiss in appreciating your pancreas, don’t feel bad: the ancients were, too. Early anatomists were certainly aware of the pancreas but mostly ignored it, and the organ’s name reflects that ho-hum attitude. Pancreas is Greek for all-meat, a reference to its seeming homogeneity from one end to the other.
Much of the neglect may well have been practical. “The pancreas has always been difficult to study,” Dr. Liddle said. For one thing, it’s hidden. Measuring some six to eight inches in length, and slippery and lobular to the touch, the yellowish-brown pancreas is located deep in the abdomen, wedged between the stomach and the spinal cord and extending horizontally right above the waistline. Think of it as an oblong eel, the tail tucked into the stomach, the head butting up against the curve of the duodenum, of the small intestine.
Add to that inaccessibility a prima donna sensitivity. “If you do anything to the pancreas, you initiate an inflammatory response,” Dr. Liddle said. “It tends to become inflamed more easily than other organs.” In fact, inflammation of the pancreas, or pancreatitis, is a relatively common and often debilitating condition, brought on by excess alcohol, drug reactions, gallstones, genetic predisposition or other reasons. Unfortunately, said Dr. Anthony Kalloo, a professor of medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, the symptoms of pancreatitis, like chronic abdominal pain radiating into the back, could be misdiagnosed or dismissed as a hypochondriac’s lament. As a result, Dr. Kalloo said, patients do not always receive the right pain medications, the optimal diet, surgery when necessary.",2009-09-14 20:09:45,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,pancreatitis
387,High Triglycerides Tied to Pancreatitis Risk,"People are often advised to keep levels of triglycerides, a type of blood fat, in check to lower the risk of a heart attack. But high triglyceride levels may be linked to another problem as well: acute pancreatitis, a sudden and potentially fatal inflammation of the pancreas.
Danish researchers tracked 116,550 men and women over seven years. The risk for acute pancreatitis increased sharply as triglyceride levels rose. At 177 to 265 milligrams per deciliter, the risk increased by 130 percent; at levels above 443, the risk increased by 770 percent. The associations remained after controlling for sex, age, alcohol intake, smoking, body mass index and other variables. The findings appeared in JAMA Internal Medicine.
Triglyceride levels below 150 are generally considered normal in terms of heart health; in earlier studies, levels above 1,000 were considered to be a risk factor for pancreatitis.
The lead author, Dr. Borge G. Nordestgaard, a clinical professor at the University of Copenhagen, said that the absolute risk of acute pancreatitis is still small for most people.",2016-11-10 18:21:18,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,pancreatitis

Ranson, a surgeon at the New York University Medical Center who developed a widely used system for predicting the outcome of pancreatic disease, died on Thursday at the University of Arkansas Medical Center in Little Rock, where he had gone for treatment. He was 57 and lived in Manhattan.
The cause of death was complications from a bone marrow transplant for myeloma, the New York University Medical Center said.
Dr. Ranson, who was director of the division of general surgery and the S. Arthur Localio Professor of Surgery at N.Y.U., helped improve the treatment of inflammation of the pancreas, which secretes digestive enzymes. Such inflammation, called pancreatitis, often affects people with gallstones or those who have been heavy drinkers. It can also arise from trauma, such as in a car accident.
In 1974, Dr. Ranson published a set of criteria to use in determining the degree of illness in patients with acute pancreatitis, which can be mild or life threatening. The Ranson Criteria, as they are called, classify cases by correlating the information from blood tests with other physical signs, like how much fluid a patient needs to keep from becoming dehydrated. That information helps physicians choose appropriate treatments and identify the patients who are most at risk.",1995-12-03 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,pancreatitis
390,Why the Pancreas Is One of the Body’s Most Important - and Misunderstood - Organs,"It’s easy to forget about the pancreas. Nestled in the abdomen, where the stomach feeds into the small intestine, this six-inch gland quietly performs many essential functions, including delivering a steady supply of enzymes to break down food so our bodies can absorb nutrients. You probably won’t know about the regular enzyme-making process of the pancreas — until something goes wrong.
Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI) is one such breakdown. A challenging condition that prevents the body from properly digesting food, exocrine pancreatic insufficiency can occur when cystic fibrosis, pancreatitis and other conditions damage the pancreas. Because many conditions can cause EPI, the exact number of people with it is unknown. But chronic pancreatitis, the leading cause of EPI, is estimated to have a prevalence of 50 for every 100,000 people, according to The National Pancreas Foundation.
“When you have EPI, your body cannot properly absorb nutrients from fats, proteins and carbohydrates,” says Dr. Alexander Shapsis, a gastroenterologist in Brooklyn, N.Y. People with EPI suffer from a number of gastrointestinal symptoms and may not get the necessary nutrition from their diets, he adds.
“A better understanding and awareness of pancreatic health can help people and their doctors recognize EPI early, so they can find treatment,” Dr. Shapsis says.",2020-06-22 22:25:48,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,pancreatitis

A. Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of cancer death in the United States, claiming some 44,330 lives a year, but there is currently no standard screening test that can detect this cancer early and “has actually been proven to save lives,” said Dr. Otis Brawley, chief medical and scientific officer for the American Cancer Society.
Individuals with a strong family history of pancreatic cancer, such as having a parent, sibling or child who developed the cancer before turning 50 or two such close relatives who developed it at any age, are at increased risk of developing the disease themselves.

393,Why Can’t We Stop Pancreatic Cancer?,"Pancreatic cancer, which will be diagnosed in about 56,770 people in the United States this year, is the only cancer with a rising mortality rate through 2014, although five-year survival has begun to inch up, from 8 percent to 9 percent by 2016. It remains the nation’s third leading cause of cancer deaths, after cancers of the lung and colon, and it is on track to overtake colon cancer within a decade. Three-fourths of people who develop pancreatic cancer die within a year of diagnosis, and only about one in 10 live five years or longer.
Perhaps like me you’ve wondered why modern medicine has thus far failed to gain the upper hand against pancreatic cancer despite having achieved major survival advances for more common cancers like breast and colon. What follows is a large part of the answer.
Although pancreatic cancer is a relatively uncommon malignancy, accounting for only 3 percent of life-threatening cancers over all, it is one of medicine’s most challenging. Aside from avoiding smoking, obesity and Type 2 diabetes, there is little a person can do to prevent it, and there is nothing comparable to mammography or colonoscopy to screen for it in seemingly healthy individuals when it is most amenable to cure.
Among the small minority of patients who are cured of this disease, it is nearly always discovered accidentally at a very early symptom-free stage during an unrelated medical procedure. By the time this cancer produces symptoms, it has nearly always spread beyond the pancreas. In fact, surgery is a treatment option in relatively few patients because the cancer is usually already too advanced at diagnosis for surgery to have survival value.",2019-09-23 09:00:02,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,pancreatitis

396,How to Minimize Pancreatic Cancer Risk,"Dr. Li added, “The distribution of fat also plays a role — the higher the waist to hip ratio, the greater the risk.” She found that cancer risk was greater the earlier in life a person becomes obese, and survival time was shorter among those who were still obese when the cancer was diagnosed.
Obesity is also the leading risk factor for the development of Type 2 diabetes, in which the body resists the action of insulin, prompting the pancreas to produce more and more of this hormone. Insulin promotes cell growth, providing a link between diabetes and the development of pancreatic cancer.
However, the relationship is complicated, to say the least. In a 2011 report in Molecular Carcinogenesis, Dr. Li noted that “diabetes or impaired glucose tolerance is present in 50 to 80 percent of patients with pancreatic cancer.” She said, “Diabetes is both a cause and consequence of cancer,” although which comes first — diabetes or cancer in the organ that controls blood glucose — is not crystal clear.
A European study of more than 800,000 people with Type 2 diabetes found this disease is sometimes an early sign of an otherwise hidden pancreatic cancer.
In studies at the Mayo Clinic, elevated glucose levels, a condition called pre-diabetes, were detected in some patients two years before pancreatic cancer was diagnosed. In these patients, Dr. Li explained, diabetes is actually a symptom of the hidden cancer. It is a type of diabetes called 3C, caused by a diseased or damaged pancreas, and medical researchers are now looking for ways for doctors to readily distinguish between Type 3C and Type 2 diabetes.
The lag time between the development of diabetes and diagnosis of cancer is a potential window of opportunity that may enable cancer detection at an early, curable stage, Dr. Li said.
If a biomarker for the cancer was identified, it may be possible to find cancer in these patients when the tumor is too small to be seen on a scan and before symptoms develop. For example, an antibody might be used that targets a molecule on small tumors.",2018-07-23 09:00:04,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,pancreatic
397,"In the Pancreas, Common Fungi May Drive Cancer","By now, you’ve probably heard that your body is teeming with bacteria. Some 100 trillion of them live on your skin, in your mouth and in the coils of your intestines. Some protect against infections and help you digest food, while others can make you seriously ill.
Fungi, viruses and protozoa call your body their home, too. Your fungal residents are less numerous than your bacteria by orders of magnitude, but as researchers are learning, these overlooked organisms play an important physiological role — and when their numbers get out of whack, they can modify your immune system and even influence the development of cancer.
A new study, published Wednesday in the journal Nature, found that fungi can make their way deep into the pancreas, which sits behind your stomach and secretes digestive enzymes into your small intestine. In mice and human patients with pancreatic cancer, the fungi proliferate 3,000-fold compared to healthy tissue — and one fungus in particular may make pancreatic tumors grow bigger.
Researchers were surprised by the presence of fungi in the typical pancreas and immense increase in their numbers in disease. “The pancreas was considered a sterile organ until a couple years ago,” said Dr. George Miller, a surgical oncologist at the New York University School of Medicine who led the study.",2019-10-03 15:18:03,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,pancreatic

399,PANCREATIC CANCER: CIGARETTE SMOKING IS STRONGEST LINK TO DEADLY DISEASE,"According to Dr. Michael Hamilton, coordinator for gastrointestinal cancer at the National Cancer Institute, ''The pancreas is so deep in the abdomen, a slow-growing cancer takes a long time to manifest itself,'' Specifically, he said, a tumor one centimeter in diameter, the minimum size commonly diagnosed, has been growing for 9 to 20 years. ''It's probably only the last couple of cell divisions that increase the tumor from a few grams to a few pounds; by then it's been around a long, long time,'' Dr. Hamilton said. Even when found while still small, a pancreatic cancer is difficult to remove completely. For one thing, it has a propensity to spread to surrounding tissues. For another, the gland is so entangled with other essential tissues that the surgery is extremely hazardous. Even in expert hands, the mortality rate of surgery is 4 percent or higher. Of every six patients with the disease, only one is a candidate for surgery at the time of diagnosis. Most are either too old, too sick or their disease is too far advanced, said Dr. Eli Glatstein, head of radiation therapy at the National Cancer Institute. Role of Pancreas
The pancreas is a double-duty organ that is essential to the processing of food and its distribution to body cells. It is best known for the small cluster of cells - the islets of Langerhans - that produce the hormone insulin, which clears glucose from the blood by distributing it to body tissues. The bulk of the pancreas, called the exocrine pancreas, produces digestive enzymes - the so-called pancreatic juice - that digest protein, fat and starch and prepare them for absorption through the small intestine. Hormones released by the small intestine and perhaps also by the stomach act as signals for the release of pancreatic juice. These hormones act in response to the passage of food through the digestive tract.
About 90 percent of pancreatic cancers involve the exocrine pancreas. Dr. Mack believes that his finding of a link between gastrectomy - partial removal of the stomach to treat ulcers - and pancreatic cancer may reflect a disturbance of the hormone-enzyme signal. ''In people with gastrectomy, there's a decrease in pancreatic secretions,'' he noted. He also said that gastrectomy removes acid-producing cells and reduces the acidity of the stomach. This, in turn, may permit the growth of microorganisms that produce potent cancer-causing chemicals called nitrosamines, Dr. Mack suggested.
As to his finding that people with allergies seem protected against pancreatic cancer, he said, ''We haven't a clue to what it means.'' Perhaps, he said, there is a common immunologic factor or some link to histamine, the substance released in allergic reactions that is also involved in the production of stomach acid.
Still other studies in animals have shown that raw soy flour, which contains inhibitors of the pancreatic enzyme, trypsin, can promote growth of pancreatic cancer. Although cooking destroys these inhibitors, the destruction is usually not complete, according to Dr. Bill D. Roebuck, one of the Dartmouth researchers. Trypsin inhibitors are also found in potatoes, lima beans and chickpeas, among other plant foods. If pancreatic trypsin is unable to act, the pancreas may be stimulated to grow to produce more, Dr. Roebuck said. He also suggested that a high-protein diet may promote pancreatic growth by increasing the demand for trypsin. Disappointment With Treatments
Treatment of pancreatic cancer has been even more puzzling. According to Dr. Glatstein, ''There is no good evidence that radiation is very helpful, even though we do it. We do it mainly to supplement surgery or, in patients who cannot be operated on, to diminish symptoms.''
A major difficulty with radiation is to be able to deliver a lethal dose to the cancer cells without harming adjacent normal tissues. The same applies to the experimental use of heat therapy, or hyperthermia, Dr. Glatstein said.",1986-03-25 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,pancreatic
400,Trace Elements and Levels of Pancreatic Cancer Risk,"A new study has found that high bodily levels of the trace elements nickel and selenium may be associated with reduced risk for pancreatic cancer, and that high levels of arsenic, cadmium and lead may increase the risk.
The study, published online Dec. 19 in the journal Gut, included 118 pancreatic cancer patients and 399 patients with other diagnoses at several hospitals in Spain. Researchers analyzed toenail samples with plasma mass spectrometry, a highly sensitive technique for detecting trace elements.
After controlling for age, sex, smoking, diabetes and other factors, the scientists found that the subjects with the highest levels of arsenic were at twice the risk for pancreatic cancer, compared with those with the lowest concentrations. Those with high levels of cadmium were at three times the risk for pancreatic cancer, while those with the highest levels of lead were at six times the risk.
Those with the highest levels of nickel and selenium, on the other hand, were at significantly lower risk for pancreatic cancer.",2012-01-02 20:20:32,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,pancreatic
401,Pancreatic Cancer Progress Reported by Researchers,"Researchers have made significant progress in understanding the biology of pancreatic tumors, suggesting that there may be ways of identifying the usually fatal cancer at a much earlier and more treatable stage.
A principal finding is that pancreatic tumors are not aggressive cancers. To the contrary, they grow slowly, taking an average of 21 years to become fatal. This creates an opportunity for detecting and removing the cancers at an early stage. At present they are diagnosed far too late, when a patient has on average only two more years to live and the cancer has already spread from the pancreas to other tissues.
The new advances, reported online Wednesday in Nature, have been made by two cooperating groups, one led by Shinichi Yachida and Christine Iacobuzio-Donahue at the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions in Baltimore, and the other by Peter Campbell and Andrew Futreal at the Sanger Institute near Cambridge, England. Both teams used a new method for decoding DNA very rapidly. This means that instead of studying one gene at a time, researchers can now afford to look across the whole genome, tracking all the mutations that occur in cancer cells.
The Johns Hopkins team was able to identify a long series of mutations that had accumulated in the original tumors of seven patients, as well as in the secondary cancers that had spread from the pancreas to the liver, lung and peritoneum, the membrane that lines the abdominal cavity.",2010-10-27 20:54:16,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,pancreatic

Ranson, a surgeon at the New York University Medical Center who developed a widely used system for predicting the outcome of pancreatic disease, died on Thursday at the University of Arkansas Medical Center in Little Rock, where he had gone for treatment. He was 57 and lived in Manhattan.
The cause of death was complications from a bone marrow transplant for myeloma, the New York University Medical Center said.
Dr. Ranson, who was director of the division of general surgery and the S. Arthur Localio Professor of Surgery at N.Y.U., helped improve the treatment of inflammation of the pancreas, which secretes digestive enzymes. Such inflammation, called pancreatitis, often affects people with gallstones or those who have been heavy drinkers. It can also arise from trauma, such as in a car accident.
In 1974, Dr. Ranson published a set of criteria to use in determining the degree of illness in patients with acute pancreatitis, which can be mild or life threatening. The Ranson Criteria, as they are called, classify cases by correlating the information from blood tests with other physical signs, like how much fluid a patient needs to keep from becoming dehydrated. That information helps physicians choose appropriate treatments and identify the patients who are most at risk.",1995-12-03 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,pancreatic

406,My Father Needed a Liver. Did It Have to Be From Me?,"My mother did not want me to donate: She did not want a large scar on my unmarried abdomen. But to be a living organ donor is a curious pressure itself, knowing that you can save a life with your decision. The health care system treats organ donors with unusual respect, too: Laboratory technicians moved me to the head of the line and congratulated me for my courage. Doctors praised me, pointing me out to other patients.
My father was like a child, wandering off on his own, his mind clouded by his failing liver. I wanted to pick him up before he never came back. But there was the remote and real possibility of death — one in 200 liver donors die because of the surgery. What if I never woke up after anesthesia? I didn’t have the courage and readiness they credited me with.
Yet at the hospital, I noticed women all around me — mothers, sisters, daughters, daughters-in-law and sisters-in-law. They were donors or donors-in-waiting, heavily outnumbering male donors. I was stunned by the apparent gender disparity in organ donation.
I used India’s Right to Information law, which empowers citizens to demand almost any information from the government, to find out if women were, indeed, the majority of donors in the country. Data from four major hospitals from 2008 to 2017 revealed that women constituted 74 percent of kidney donors. Between 2009 and 2018, women were 60.5 percent of donors for liver transplants, according to the data I received from five private hospitals. Those are all legally verified transplants, approved by Indian law. They don’t include the organs stolen from women.
Data from several other countries shows that the majority of living organ donors are women. In the United States, which performs the highest number of living donor organ transplants in the world, women were 62 percent of kidney donors between 2008 and 2017 and 53 percent of liver donors.
And women represent a small proportion of organ transplant recipients in India. Based on the data I received, women made up 19 percent of recipients of kidney transplants and 24 percent for liver. Indian women give more and receive far less.
An Indian crowdfunding platform, Milaap, further illustrated this gender disparity. Of the 495 funded liver transplants — among the most expensive surgeries in India — 66 percent of the campaigns were for men and 34 percent for women. The gap is narrower for pediatric transplants: Of the 305 pediatric liver transplants campaigned for on the platform, 56 percent were for boys and 44 percent for girls. Yet, biliary atresia — the most common condition that necessitates pediatric liver transplants — is slightly more common in girls than in boys.",2018-12-15 19:30:04,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,biliary atresia

408,First U.S. Liver Transplant From Live Donor Is Set,"Dr. Broelsch said he was confident that the living donor approach would be successful and would transform the field of pediatric liver transplants. ''But doing it for the first time is a big threshold,'' he said. The surgery today is expected to take eight or nine hours and cost $100,000 to $300,000, and the health insurance carrier will pay almost all of the cost.
Surgeons in three other countries went ahead with liver transplants from living parents to babies in recent months. Surgeons first in Australia, then in Brazil and Japan tried the operation on desperately ill children as emergency procedures. One child has died.
The crucial difference between those operations and the one to be performed today in Chicago is that the patient in Chicago is still relatively healthy, whereas those in the three other countries were about to die and could not wait for a cadaver organ to become available.
The Chicago team, which includes Dr. Peter F. Whittington, a pediatrician, plans to do another liver transplant from a living donor in the near future, taking a piece of the organ from 20-year-old Robert Jones of Millington, Tenn., and transplanting it into his 15-month-old daughter, Sarina Michelle. That operation was to have been performed Wednesday, but Sarina became ill, and doctors decided to postpone surgery until she is better.
Dr. Andrews said transplant surgeons were also considering other organs that could be transplanted from living donors. Some researchers are experimenting in animals with living-donor transplants of pieces of lungs and small bowels.
Before initiating a living-donor program, the University of Chicago group deliberated for a year, holding public meetings with the medical team and ethicists. On Aug. 31, they published a paper in The New England Journal of Medicine detailing their plans and their resolution of such ethical issues as selecting candidates for the new operation and balancing the risks and benefits to donors and recipients. And they inisted that the donors go home and spend a month thinking over their decision to give up a part of their liver.
The Chicago group has decided to use parents or, perhaps, older brothers and sisters of the babies as donors. ''When the donor is genetically and emotionally related to the recipient,'' they explained in the medical journal, ''the intangible benefits of saving a life are most rewarding and the risk-benefit ratio is most favorable.''

412,Girl Gets Liver From Father In 2d Live-Donor Transplant,"Dr. Peter Whitington, director of pediatric transplant services at the hospital, said the operation would not be the most difficult hurdle for Sarina to overcome. ''Her difficulty is going to be recovery, convalescing, regaining nutritional status, overcoming any infections,'' he said.
Sarina's mother, Michelle Jones, 21, said that the family had no reservations about the surgery and that the hardest part of the ordeal had been the waiting.
Sarina has suffered since birth from biliary atresia, the same usually fatal disorder that afflicted 21-month-old Alyssa Smith, who last week received part of her mother's liver at the University of Chicago in the first living-donor liver transplant in the United States.
Alyssa, of Schertz, Tex., near San Antonio, is doing well today, Dr. Whitington said, with her liver function ''rapidly improving toward normal'' and no signs of rejecting the transplant.
Sarina was flown to Chicago a week ago, followed by her father and mother, but the surgery was postponed because Sarina was recovering from an infection. She has been very malnourished because ''the liver is absolutely essential to maintain the body's nutrition,'' Dr. Whitington said. Between 25 percent and 50 percent of the children who need liver transplants are expected to die without them because too few organs are available from cadavers. Dr. Broelsch pioneered the technique of transplanting parts of adult livers into children, whose abdominal cavities are too small for whole ones. Partial livers grow as the child grows, and the living donors regenerate the liver tissue they have lost. YOUNGEST LUNG TRANSPLANT",1989-12-09 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,biliary atresia
413,A Gift of Life to Fiji From Valhalla,"Dr. Piper, though, did not know what condition the child would arrive in, nor did he have a prospective donor. ''It was hard over the phone to get a handle on her condition.'' he said. ''When I saw her for the first time, I would not say she was in her last day of life, but it is reasonable to say that in three to six months she would have died. She had far advanced liver disease.''
The first living-related liver transplant was performed at the University of Chicago in 1989. Since then, 700 such operations have been performed worldwide. The donor and recipient must have a matching blood type, although they need not be genetically related. Dr. Piper said there have only been two cases in Chicago where they were not related. The operation has some advantages over transplants using a cadaver donor.
''The living-related transplants will become more common because we can time the transplant to when we want to do the operation,'' he said. ''With other transplants, the patient has to go on a waiting list for a cadaver and could be very sick before a liver is found, if it is ever found.''
In this case, Mrs. Sharan was found to be a perfect match with her daughter and underwent a two-and-a-half hour operation on June 25 to remove part of her liver. That part was then put in her 11-pound daughter during a four-and-a-half-hour operation the same day. Both operations went well. Shania's body has not rejected her new liver, which Dr. Piper said is unusual. Seventy percent of recipients endure at least one rejection.
But Shania had a setback soon after being removed from a ventilator. ''She developed a severe life-threatening lung disease, known as adult respiratory distress syndrome,'' said Dr. Carey Goltzman, chief of pediatric critical care and director of the pediatric intensive care unit. ''She probably had a mild virus before the operation. Out of 100 adult patients who develop this in a hospital, less than half will leave through the front door.

414,"Abdominal Pain, Repeated Vomiting, Quickened Heartbeat","1. Symptoms ""Maybe I am crazy,"" the young woman said, wiping her eyes impatiently. ""All I know is that I throw up whenever I eat, but all the tests say that nothing is wrong. I just don't know anymore."" The exhausted 26-year-old looked up at the doctor expectantly. Her colorful barrettes and the dark smudges under her eyes gave her the appearance of an irritable child.
Dr. Stanley Ottinger listened attentively. She seemed thinner and paler than when he saw her three months before. During that visit, she also complained of nausea -- a symptom she attributed to the birth-control ring he had previously prescribed for her. The device, a plastic ring that, like the more common patch, secretes estrogen, was removed by the patient a few weeks before. The nausea remained. Her earlier exam revealed nothing unusual but some tenderness in the right upper quadrant of her abdomen. Ottinger had sent her for an ultrasound to look for gallstones. None were found. Initially, the nausea was intermittent -- now it was every day. Eating anything triggered spasms and heaving. She didn't have diarrhea or pain -- just continuous nausea and vomiting.
After she had stopped using birth control, she went to her primary-care doctor, who thought she might be pregnant. (She wasn't.) She had seen a gastroenterologist and a surgeon. She had been started on half a dozen medicines -- several to stop the nausea, another to speed up her digestion, a third to reduce her stomach acid. She had had tests: two to look for gallstones; a barium swallow and a CT scan to look for blockages; she had even had a tiny camera put into her stomach to look for ulcers. Her blood was sent to check her liver and pancreas. Her stomach was tested for a bacterium that causes ulcers. Everything was normal. ""I'm losing my faith in doctors,"" she said. ""It seems like everyone's attitude is: 'I don't know what it is. Try this pill and call me next week.' They think it's all in my head. Do you?""
2. Investigation The doctor wasn't sure what to think. As an OB-GYN, Ottinger saw a lot of nausea, but the cause was usually obvious. If it wasn't pregnancy, then it was typically either an ulcer or gallbladder disease -- both of which she had already been tested for.",2004-09-26 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,cholelithiasis
415,The Unusual Tale of the Roaming Gallstones,"“You have a mass in your chest, near your lung,” the voice on the phone said. The 71-year-old woman listened quietly as her doctor explained what the CT scan showed. The doctor suggested that she see a chest surgeon to figure out what it was and what they should do about it.
The woman wasn’t surprised to hear that she had a mass. That’s why she went to see her doctor in the first place. Weeks earlier, when she was rubbing her chronically aching back, she noticed that there was a subtle bulge between the next-to-last rib on her right side and the rib just above it. The mass felt hard, almost as if she was growing a new rib. And then it just kept growing. She went to see her doctor when the bulge was the size of an apricot.
[Watch ‘Diagnosis,’ a new show from The Times and Netflix.]
Her doctor ordered a chest X-ray. The woman was puzzled when her doctor called to tell her that the X-ray was completely normal. But when a physician assistant she had been seeing about dietary supplements looked at the film, he noticed that the scan hadn’t gone low enough to capture the mass. When the woman called her doctor back with that news, the doctor ordered a CT scan of the chest with contrast. That would show them what was there, the doctor assured her. It had, and now she needed a surgeon.
Finding a Doctor
When the woman told her daughter about the results of the CT scan and the doctor’s recommendations, her daughter immediately started searching for a surgeon. She found one at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. The woman called the surgeon’s office and sent over the imaging. The office said it would call with an appointment if the surgeon thought he could help. Four hours later, the office called back with an appointment — actually, two. The surgeon thought she should also see one of his colleagues. They were each surgeons specializing in sarcomas — the kind of tumors that grow in muscle and bone. But this second doctor operated on tumors in the abdomen and other areas. Although the mass was clearly in the back of the chest wall, it was located below the diaphragm, and so it was outside the area of the first surgeon’s expertise.",2019-09-11 09:00:02,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,gallstones
416,THE DOCTOR'S WORLD; GALLSTONES REMOVED WITHOUT MAJOR SURGERY,"The gallbladder is a sac attached to the undersurface of the liver in the right upper portion of the abdomen, just below the rib cage. The sac retains the bile formed by the liver until it is needed to help in digestion.
Gallstones often irritate the lining of the gallbladder, producing inflammation and pain that can be severe and can last several hours. Gallstones can lead to a variety of symptoms such as belching, nausea, vomiting and an aching pain that typically occurs in the abdomen just below the breastbone. Sometimes the pain moves to the right upper side of the abdomen, or around the sides to the back or shoulder, or straight through the body to the upper back.
Gallstones can become dangerous when they escape from the gallbladder to lodge in the outflow tubes known as the cystic and common bile ducts. An errant stone can block the drainage of bile from the gallbladder into the small intestine.
Gallstones can lead to another complication, pancreatitis, which is a potentially fatal condition involving inflammation of the pancreas, the gland that produces several digestive substances.
Because gallbladder attacks can recur unpredictably and sometimes can lead to potentially fatal complications, the standard treatment has been surgery. However, in recent years many people have chosen to take chenodiol pills as a way of dissolving gallstones without surgery. But dissolution with these pills is not always successful and, when it is, it usually takes from one to three years. Diarrhea is a common side effect. Moreover, 25 percent to 50 percent of those who take chenodiol form gallstones again 5 to 10 years later.
The lithotripter machine that has been so effective in shattering kidney stones has not had the same success in crushing gallstones, the Mayo Clinic doctors say, because it breaks gallstones into fragments that often cannot be passed out of the gallbladder and their total dissolution would require additional treatment with ether solvent or other chemicals.
Dr. Thistle, a pioneer in developing chenodiol therapy, explored other approaches because of the drug's drawbacks. He reviewed the articles doctors have written about the many solvents they have tested. Doctors have long known that conventional ether is a good solvent for cholesterol gallstones, but they abandoned attempts to use it for such therapy because diethyl ether turns into a potentially explosive gas at body temperature.",1985-09-17 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,gallstones
417,"For People Who Have Fair Skins, Suntans May Raise Gallstone Risks","FAIR-SKINNED people who sunbathe a lot may have a significantly greater chance of developing gallstones than people who shy away from the burning rays, a new study suggests.
The study was done by Dr. Stan Pavel, a biochemist and dermatologist at University Hospital Leiden in the Netherlands. Dr. Pavel compared 206 whites of all skin types, examining their attitudes toward sunbathing and the incidence of gallstones among them.
He found that people who reported enjoying sunbathing ran twice the risk of developing gallstones of general population. For people prone to burning after sunbathing, primarily those with red hair and very pale skin, the risk was 20 times as great.
The study was recently outlined in a letter in The Lancet, a British medical journal. It is to be reported in full later this year in The Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health.",1992-02-05 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,gallstones
418,A GALLSTONE PILL UNDERGOES TESTS,"In those studies, the doctors said that CDC had totally or partially dissolved cholesterol gallstones in four of seven patients. On‐going studies with this group have shown that the 5irug has completely dissolved stones in three patients and led to continuing dissolution in three others.
British Trials Ended
British researchers who prescribed CDC in lower doses have confirmed the Mayo Clinic results. But because of the monkey toxicity studies, British officials have temporarily stopped clinical trials with CDC.
“The drug works better, faster and at lower doses than we expected but it may be more dangerous than we thought,” Dr. Hofmann said in a telephone interview from his laboratory at the gastroenterology unit of the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. Dr. Hofmann went on:
“No patient in the study group had to stop taking the drug because of toxicity. The patients are all doing very well.”
Dr. Hofmann's evaluation is based on tests of liver function and on examination of small pieces of liver removed by a needle biopsy of the patients in the study group.
But rhesus monkeys who were sacrificed after taking larger doses of the drug for 15 weeks were unexpectedly found to have evidence of liver damage at autopsy. The precise cause of the toxic reacion is not known.
Other animal studies have shown CDC to be harmless in mice and rats.
More Cautious Approach
Because of the monkey toxicity, the Food and Drug Administration and the researchers have taken a more cautious approach in the human studies that are needed before the drug can be licensed for routine prescription use.
Dr. Hofmann and Dr. Wolff said that studies would continue on patients for whom CDC had been prescribed. But, they said, no new patients would be added to the study groups at the Mayo Clinic or elsewhere until scientists had independently evaluated the data collected to date. For example, a committee of ouside expert pathologists is expected to examine liver biopsies from the patients who volunteered to take the experimental drug at the Mayo Clinic.",1973-10-07 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,gallstones
419,Test Drug Dissolves Gallstones,"Cause Is Unknown
Scientists say that they do not know exactly what causes the nuclei of gallstones to form and then to grow by accretion. But whether the stones are the size of a thumb or as small as a tiny piece of gravel, they can lead to gall bladder attacks characterized by excruciating pain, Vomiting, chills, fever and jaundice, or yellow skin. In some cases, even the most astute physician can have difficulty in distinguishing ‘other bladder attacks from other conditions like heart attacks, perforated ulcers, pneumonia and acute kidney disease.
Yet in a large number of patients, the stones may be “silent,” a medical term that doctors use to indicate that the stones produce no apparent symptoms.
Doctors say that it is impossible to predict which patient will develop sudden gall bladder attacks and serious complications that, if not treated immediately, can be fatal. Accordingly, when gallstones are detected on X‐rays, many but not all doctors often recommend that patients whose medical histories permit it undergo elective gall bladder surgery to prevent such attacks.
Occurs Naturally in Bile
Bile is a concentrated detergent solution that includes CDC, the drug that the Mayo doctors used experimentally. CDC occurs naturally in human and animal bile but it is very difficult to purify, Dr. Hoffmann said in an interview.
The Mayo team's apparent limited experimental success in using CDC to dissolve or shrink gallstones was based on work done by other researchers in recent years.
Though doctors long have known that human gallstones dissolve when placed in dog, pig or sheep gall bladders, they were still handicapped in finding a medical treatment by lack of detailed knowledge about the biochemistry, physical characteristics and molecular biology of human bile.
The Mayo team pointed out that Dr. Allan G. Rewbridge in 1937 suggested that cholesterol gallstones resulted from a deficiency of one or more bile compounds. He described the dissolution of gallstones in two patients who had received CDC and other compounds.",1972-01-06 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,gallstones
420,"All Babies Cry, but How Much Is Too Much?","Common conditions that can be mistaken for colic are acid reflux, when stomach acid comes up into the esophagus or mouth, and protein allergies. Acid reflux typically causes crying several times a day after feedings and frequent spitting up. Protein allergies cause babies to be fussy all the time, and result in blood or mucus in the stool, which can be detected with lab tests.
Remember: It’s not you fault, and it will eventually go away.
If your baby receives a diagnosis of colic, then your pediatrician is likely to reassure you that you’re doing a great job and things will improve with time. “It doesn’t mean you’re a bad parent, and it doesn’t mean that your kid doesn’t like you,” counseled Dr. DeBlasio. He tells parents that it’s natural to feel frustrated and reminds them that colicky kids won’t be this difficult forever.
There are no generally accepted treatments for colic, so Dr. DeBlasio recommends simple changes to help with the gas, such as frequent burping and switching to bottles that reduce air swallowing, such as ones with angled tips or bottles with collapsible plastic bags. He tells parents, however, not to spend a lot of time and money trying different formulas or other supposed treatments.
There are many alternative and herbal remedies marketed for colic, like gripe water, but parents should be wary. Gripe water no longer contains alcohol, like it did in the 1800s, but there is also no evidence it works. “There have been some small studies that have looked at anything from acupuncture and chiropracty to a huge variety of herbal supplements,” said Dr. Kristen Slack, M.D., a pediatrician at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia. “Really, there’s no consistent evidence to suggest that any of that is helpful.” Unregulated supplements and spinal manipulation may also carry risks to the baby.
If you breastfeed, consider probiotics.
Researchers are still trying to nail down a definitive cause for colic.
One theory is that a contributing factor is inflammation in the gut from a less-than-ideal collection of microbes that first colonize the infant’s intestines. Dr. Marc Rhoads, M.D., a pediatric gastroenterologist at the University of Texas at Houston, has looked for signs of inflammation in babies’ stools, measuring a biomarker called calprotectin that signals irritable bowel syndrome in adults. His research group found much higher levels of calprotectin in infants with colic than in infants without it, suggesting inflammation, and also found differences in the microbial communities in their guts.
To help correct this microbial imbalance, research groups in several countries have tested a strain of the bacterium Lactobacillus reuteri, isolated from the breast milk of a Peruvian woman. A meta-analysis that combined multiple smaller studies reports that colicky babies who were breastfed and received the strain as a probiotic cried about 46 fewer minutes per day than babies who received a placebo. Dr. Rhoads conducted a small trial that established the safety of the probiotic, which can be purchased as Gerber Soothe Probiotic Colic Drops or BioGaia ProTectis Baby.
While Dr. Rhoads is confident that gut inflammation plays a role in colic, he said many questions remain. “We know that those drops can help,” he said. “We don’t know that there wouldn’t be better results if they were combined with another probiotic, or if there are strains that might even be better than the ones we’re using now.”",2020-04-18 21:50:58,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,colic

Colic  uncontrolled screaming and crying in an otherwise healthy infant  can be one of the most stressful parts of raising a newborn.
While its cause is uncertain, there is evidence that it stems in part from gastrointestinal discomfort. That may explain why chamomile tea, which according to research can ease intestinal spasms, has long been a home remedy for colic. Various studies have examined its usefulness, finding it simple, inexpensive and fairly effective.

One group received either an herbal tea (served warm or cool) made primarily with German chamomile, and the other placebo tea. The scientists reported that each infant was offered either the tea or placebo with every bout of colic, up to 150 milliliters  a little more than half a cup  no more than three times a day. After a week, “parents reported that the tea eliminated the colic in 57 percent of the infants,” the researchers reported, “whereas placebo was helpful in only 26 percent.

430,Personal Health; Gallbladder surgery is easier. Is it too common?,"The risk of recurrence is eliminated when the gallbladder is removed, either by open or laparoscopic surgery. Open cholecystectomy is one of the safest of major operations. It does, however, require general anesthesia, three to five days in the hospital and up to six weeks of recovery before life returns to normal. Postoperative pain is considerable, but the rate of complications and death is very low. A Simpler Procedure
In laparoscopic surgery, a small incision is made near the navel and three puncture holes are made under the rib cage to introduce a lighted scope and video camera and the operating tools. Carbon dioxide is pumped into the abdomen to separate abdominal muscles and fat from the underlying organs. Surgeons -- ideally, two working together -- watch a television monitor as they tie off the duct and artery feeding the gallbladder, free the gallbladder from its perch under the liver and slip the diseased organ out through the umbilical incision. Most of the carbon dioxide is then sucked out of the abdomen and the wounds are covered with the equivalent of Band-Aids.
The patient usually spends just one night in the hospital and can return to normal activities in three to five days, at most a week. The greatest discomfort is likely to be a day or so of abdominal cramps until the residual carbon dioxide is absorbed into the bloodstream.
Simple though it may sound, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is not innocuous. In fact, it has been associated with a higher than usual rate of injury to the bile duct, although this rate is still low -- one-tenth to two-tenths of 1 percent. The rate of inadvertent injury is typically higher in operations done by surgeons new to the procedure.
Sometimes, after starting a laparoscopic procedure, surgeons find it necessary to switch to an open cholecystectomy, for example, when the gallbladder cannot be freed from the liver or if stones are found unexpectedly in the common bile duct. Although many doctors believe that laparoscopic cholecystectomy is ideal for patients who are poor surgical risks, the occasional necessity to change midstream to the open operation suggests otherwise. Deciding on Surgery
For a vast majority of patients, the decision to undergo surgery should be based on recurring pain typical of gallbladder trouble followed by diagnostic tests showing the presence of obstructive stones or an inflamed gallbladder. Preventive surgery in patients free of symptoms but known to have gallstones is recommended for children, people with sickle cell disease and certain groups, like American Indians,who face an especially high risk of developing gallbladder cancer, an otherwise rare disease.
The pain of gallstones typically occurs in the upper right side of the abdomen, often after a big meal, and may spread to the right shoulder or other areas of the chest or abdomen. Gallstone pain is steady, usually lasting two to four hours and often peaking about midnight. If the gallbladder itself is inflamed, the pain can be severe and be accompanied by nausea, vomiting and fever.
People with such symptoms should first consult a general doctor, like an internist or gastroenterologist. The diagnostic workup should include an ultrasound examination. If tests indicate that surgery is warranted, ask to be referred to a surgeon highly experienced in doing laparoscopic cholecystectomies. The complication rate declines sharply as the surgeon's expertise rises.",1995-05-31 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,cholecystitis
431,"Abdominal Pain, Bloodshot Eyes, Pounding Headache","Inouye, a gerontologist, realized that she would need help identifying other possibilities. She contacted the infectious-disease expert on call, Dr. Jeffrey Topal. She briefly described her friend's situation. ""What kinds of infections should I be thinking about?"" she asked. Topal began to list more than a dozen possibilities. The fever and muscle pain were suggestive of an influenzalike illness, and some types of flu cause mild liver abnormalities. But it wasn't flu season. The Epstein-Barr virus, which causes mononucleosis, was possible, but she didn't have the characteristic sore throat and swollen lymph nodes. The persistent headache suggested a viral meningitis; enterovirus was the most common cause. But that doesn't often cause liver damage. Headache and conjunctivitis were common symptoms of leptospirosis -- an unusual disease transmitted by farm and wild animals -- but it, too, was a summertime illness, frequently picked up while swimming in contaminated water. Finally, adenovirus was a common cause of conjunctivitis, but it rarely affects the liver. Inouye thanked him, hung up and began reading up on the diseases he had named.
When she returned to the hospital the next day, Inouye peppered her friend with questions, trying to discover how she might have come into contact with any of the unusual pathogens she had been reading about. Her call to the specialist had reminded her that the secret to any infection is exposure. Had she been around anyone sick? Had she traveled anywhere recently? Any recent tick bites? Had she been swimming in fresh water? No, no, no and no.
Inouye was frustrated but undeterred. The fever, abdominal pain and abnormal liver tests were common symptoms of a variety of diseases. The unrelenting headache along with the conjunctivitis were more unusual. There are a number of pathogens that can cause conjunctivitis; a few can cause both conjunctivitis and headache. She could find none, other than leptospirosis, that caused these symptoms and abdominal symptoms. But everything she read said that leptospirosis was a rare disease, and the patient didn't fit the typical profile. It was mostly a disease of farmers and veterinarians , not urban internists.
3. Resolution Discouraged, she went to bed. As she lay in the dark mulling over all she had read, she suddenly had a moment of clarity. ""I realized that no matter how unlikely it seemed, it had to be leptospirosis,"" she explained to me later. ""There had to be an exposure, because it was the only diagnosis that fit the whole picture.""
At 6 a.m. she called her friend. ""I think you could have leptospirosis,"" she told her. ""Now we have to figure out how you got it."" Inouye pressed her for any fresh-water exposure in a farm or rural setting. The patient immediately recalled that the week before she had spent a day with her son in a glider competition at an upstate New York farm. It had been a rainy weekend, and the ground was soaked. She and her son had run through the puddles as they retrieved the glider after each flight. She had gotten drenched. ""I might as well have been swimming,"" she remembered.
Inouye called the doctor charged with her friend's care and laid out her diagnosis of leptospirosis. He was excited and relieved. The patient had presented a confusing picture, but this new diagnosis made sense. He sent off blood and urine to confirm the diagnosis and started the patient on doxycycline, the antibiotic of choice for leptospirosis.
More than a month later, the confirmation came, and by then the patient was back to normal. Reflecting on her illness and nearly missed diagnosis, she was philosophical: ""We're taught that common things are common, and leptospirosis won't fit when you use that paradigm. I was trying not to be a doctor, but even if I had tried to diagnose myself, I wouldn't have come up with that. I'm glad Sharon did.""

She had participated in oral arguments held by conference call on Tuesday morning, and the court said she planned to take part in Wednesday’s arguments by telephone from the hospital.
The court said Justice Ginsburg was treated for acute cholecystitis, a benign gallbladder condition, at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. “Following oral arguments on Monday,” a statement from the court said, “the justice underwent outpatient tests at Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington, D.C., that confirmed she was suffering from a gallstone that had migrated to her cystic duct, blocking it and causing an infection.”
The treatment did not involve surgery, the statement said without elaboration. Gallstones can sometimes be removed through a scope passed down the digestive tract. If the blockage has caused an infection, it may be treated with antibiotics.

England is without a team in the semifinals for the first time since 2003.
Manchester United, sparked by the quick return of Wayne Rooney from an ankle injury sustained in last week’s 2-1 first-leg loss in Munich, led by 2-0 after only seven minutes on goals by Darron Gibson and Nani.
Nani gave Manchester United a 3-0 lead — and a 4-2 aggregate advantage — when he scored in the 41st minute. But two minutes later Bayern’s Ivica Olic, who scored the game-winner last week in Germany, took advantage of a misplay by Michael Carrick and slid a low shot past goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar.
United played a man short when defender Rafael da Silva was ejected five minutes into the second half for clutching and grabbing Franck Ribéry, and receiving a second yellow card.
Robben missed the first leg with a calf injury, but his comeback was overshadowed by that of Rooney, who had been expected to be sidelined for at least two weeks.",2010-04-08 02:35:43,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,cholecystitis

Then, days before, his surgeon tells him that plans have changed. His surgery will be put off because of concerns about the spread of the coronavirus.
Doctors and patients throughout the country are having difficult conversations like this.
As Covid-19 cases have surged, hospitals have suspended not just elective surgeries like hip replacements, hernia repairs and cosmetic procedures, but even crucial treatments like cancer surgery.
These postponements can be wrenching and frustrating for doctors and have forced patients into a battle on two fronts, against their disease and against the coronavirus.
Traveling to hospitals or clinics for tests, procedures and treatments might place patients at greater risk of coronavirus infection. Cancer treatments like chemotherapy, radiation and surgery might weaken a patient’s immune system, impairing his ability to fight off the virus.

439,"'THE WORLD IS ROOTING FOR YOU,' HEART PATIENT HEARD BEFORE SURGERY","Dr. Chase N. Peterson, the university's vice president for health sciences, said at a news conference that Dr. Clark had to be regarded as ''worse off'' now than he was before the latest operation. The reasons, Dr. Peterson said, were because it was his third time in such a short period that the patient had had an operation and general anesthesia and because he had a patch of pneumonia. Mental Status Brighter
Nevertheless, within hours after he came out of the anesthesia from Tuesday's operation, Dr. Clark's mental status was reported to be much brighter than it was all last week. At that time, his mental status remained sluggish from the effects of seizures suffered on Dec. 7.
Mrs. Clark told doctors today that she believed the quality of her husband's mental status, as well as the length of the periods that he was lucid, had improved significantly since the latest operation. Members of the medical team headed by Dr. William C. DeVries also agreed that her husband ''is brighter now than before surgery,'' Dr. Peterson said.
Dr. Peterson said he could offer no other explanation than the fact that Dr. Clark had completed the one-week period that he said it could take him to recover from the seizures. Although there is no evidence that they inflicted any brain damage on Dr. Clark, the doctors said it would be weeks before it could be determined with certainty whether there had been subtle brain damage.
Dr. Peterson said, too, that chest X-rays showed that the area of pneumonia in the lower lobe of Dr. Clark's left lung had become smaller than it was Tuesday and that his temperature had dropped to between 100 and 101 degrees Fahrenheit from a peak of about 103.5 degrees on Monday evening. The pneumonia presumably is bacterial in type, although Dr. Peterson did not state the specific organism.",1982-12-16 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,ileus

More Symptoms
After discussions with the rest of his team, Fisher started the patient on broad-spectrum antibiotics. If this was an infection, it might be one picked up during his last hospital stay, and those bugs could be resistant to the usual drugs. The surgeons were confident that the wound wasn’t infected and recommended keeping it covered.
Over the next 48 hours, the man developed other symptoms: Tiny muscles in his face and legs began to twitch in what is known as fasciculations, causing him to make strange expressions. He’d slur his words as if his tongue had forgotten how to speak. But moments later, his speech would be clear. He was agitated at night, then sleepy all day. It could be delirium, Fisher reasoned, but it was the strangest version he ever saw. Still, he was just halfway through his first year of training. There was plenty he didn’t know.
At home, on his day off, Fisher found himself worrying about the patient. He turned to the internet. When trying to diagnose, one trick Fisher was taught was to focus on the most unusual symptoms. These would have the fewest number of causes, and if you could find some overlap in the causes for two of the rarer symptoms, then the diagnosis would most likely lie in that region of overlap. Fisher started with the mysterious ileus and added the strange twitches he saw. But nothing fit.
Fisher added the thymus tumor to the search. And yes! Several autoimmune disorders linked to thymomas could cause neurological symptoms. Myasthenia gravis was the most common — a disease in which muscles weaken quickly because of an antibody that interferes with the nerves’ ability to tell the muscles to move. But this wasn’t the patient’s problem, so Fisher kept looking. Finally, he found one that seemed to include all the man’s symptoms. It was a rare disorder known as Morvan syndrome, often associated with a tumor in the thymus gland. At the end of the 19th century, the French physician Augustin Marie Morvan described four patients with neurological abnormalities, caused, he hypothesized, by an overcharged nervous system, which could result in many of the symptoms the patient experienced: a rapid heart rate, wildly variable blood pressure, fasciculations, insomnia, hallucinations, ileus and loss of appetite. This syndrome is now understood to be a disease in which errant antibodies interfere with the on-off switch of certain nerve cells.

Confirming a Hunch
Fisher was excited by his find but knew that his team would be skeptical. Residents were often reminded to look for horses rather than zebras when hearing hoofbeats. He recalled that neurology was consulted about the patient’s muscle twitches when he was last in the hospital. Fisher reviewed the consultants’ note. They, too, had thought of a thymoma-triggered disorder. They’d sent blood to the Mayo Clinic to look for proof. Fisher called the Mayo Clinic lab and found that the tests were positive for the antibodies linked to Morvan. Positive results were so unusual that they had to double-check them before the answer could be officially reported.
That was enough for Fisher. The neurologists were consulted again. Even without the final results, they recommended action. The way to treat a disease caused by wayward antibodies is, paradoxically, to add more antibodies. Certain autoimmune diseases can be slowed or even stopped by the infusion of antibodies culled from other people’s blood, a treatment known as intravenous immunoglobulin, or IVIG. It isn’t clear why this works, but it does.",2018-10-02 09:00:02,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,ileus
441,Pataki Stays in Hospital 5th Day as Intestinal Problems Persist,"Gov. George E. Pataki was being fed intravenously yesterday, his fifth day in a Westchester County hospital where he had surgery to remove a perforated appendix last week. A doctor at the hospital said the governor would almost certainly remain in the hospital today.
""His intestinal function still has not returned to normal,"" said Dr. Wiji Ratnathicam, the senior attending surgeon at the Hudson Valley Hospital Center in Cortlandt Manor. ""The only progress I have to report is that there doesn't seem to be any sign of an infection.""
Mr. Pataki, 60, entered the hospital Thursday after complaining of abdominal pains. Hours later, doctors determined that he had acute appendicitis and removed his appendix.
""At this point in time, we're putting his intestines at rest,"" Dr. Ratnathicam said. ""And if his intestinal functions don't return to normal, then he won't eliminate whatever is in his intestines. In this case, it's not appropriate to give him laxatives.""",2006-02-21 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,ileus
442,ARTIFICIAL HEART RECIPIENT SHOWING SIGNS OF RECOVERY FROM SEIZURES,"Nevertheless, he said Dr. Clark's doctors took both his response to his wife and his communication by spelling as signs of further gradual improvement in his recovery from the seizures, whose cause has not been definitely determined. Dr. Clark has had no further seizures, and his latest brain wave test was reported as normal.
Dr. Peterson also said that results of a test called the lumbar puncture had given the physicians further assurance that Dr. Clark had suffered neither a stroke nor meningitis, which is a potentially fatal infection of the membrane that covers the brain.
Today a physical therapist was continuing the passive and active exercises that are designed to prevent Dr. Clark's muscles from withering away. Such withering, called atrophy of disuse, can occur quickly after operations if the body's muscles are not used in such exercises as bending the legs and moving the arms through a range of motions.
The doctors are increasing Dr. Clark's caloric intake through a feeding tube to about 4,000 calories today. The increased intake reflected the fact that he has overcome a condition called ileus, which commonly follows surgery, and that his bowel function has returned to normal. ''We know he is absorbing that food,'' Dr. Peterson said. Some Tubes Removed
The doctors are also removing some of the intravenous tubes in Dr. Clark's body to decrease chances of infection and other complications. They are also taking precautions to prevent pneumonia, one of the complications about which the medical team is most concerned.",1982-12-11 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,ileus

The second operation was ""to alleviate a blockage in his digestive system,"" Mr. Pataki's director of communications, David Catalfamo, said in a statement. It was issued shortly after the governor returned to his room at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia hospital in Manhattan.
Mr. Pataki was transferred to the Manhattan hospital yesterday morning from Hudson Valley Hospital Center in Cortlandt Manor in Westchester County, where he underwent the emergency appendectomy. Doctors there said that after the appendectomy, Mr. Pataki experienced an ileus, which means that for some reason the bowel stopped functioning normally, producing a blockage.
Reasons for such a blockage may be pressure, or looping of the bowel, or paralysis, which stops the normal muscle action of the bowel. Surgery may be required.",2006-02-22 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,ileus

Mr. Pataki, spending his 13th day in a hospital, said he felt ""a little bit stronger every day.""
Wearing a blazer, a sweater and corduroy pants, and showing no evidence of the intravenous tubes through which he receives antibiotics and nutrition, Mr. Pataki spoke for just three minutes.

The case is indicative of the powers of modern medicine to prolong the lives of the hopelessly ill. To an ethics professor familiar with the details, it also represents ''a multiple tragedy: the accident, the parents' denial and delusioned hopes, the abdication of professional responsibility and the misallocation of societal and medical resources.''
Age 27: After IV (intravenous) feedings for several days, naso-gastric tube feedings were begun. There were times when very soft foods in small amounts were introduced and occasionally swallowed. The urine output was adequate, but she developed several episodes of urinary tract infection. There were occasional periods where the body would become rigid and spastic with occasional jerking. The Foley catheter was changed about every three weeks, the naso-gastric tube about 10 to 14 days. Her position was changed every three to four hours with extensive skin care and range of motion exercises to the extremities three to four times a day. Antibiotics and aspirin were given. During this period she was seen by six neurologists and neurosurgeons. Age 28: The patient was transferred to the University of Illinois Research Hospital for 30 days. The evaluation resulted in a diagnosis of ''suspect contusion cerebral cortex and basal ganglia; encephalomalacia of the internal capsule and/or midbrain due to hemorrhage, not improved.'' She was returned to the hospital, where she was maintained on naso-gastric feedings of approximately 2,000 calories a day. She experienced several episodes of aspiration pneumonia and urinary tract infections. She was also begun on Dilantin for her convulsive disorders and spastic movements. Age 29: She was transferred for 12 days to Wesley Memorial Hospital for evaluation. No change in the diagnosis. She had several severe convulsions with cyanosis (a blueish tinge due to oxygen deficiency) this year. Age 30: The patient's weight was stable. She was having more frequent convulsive episodes. There was an abrasion on the buttocks which healed satisfactorily with routine care. There was also some redness of the coccygeal area (lower back) for about four days. Age 31: More difficulties with aspiration pneumonitis. The convulsions were persisting, with cyanosis at times. The Foley catheter would have to be reinserted more frequently and usually larger sizes were necessary. Age 32: Several units of whole blood were given for an anemia. She also underwent a thoracentesis at which time 200 cc of fluid was obtained. The patient was known to have an ileus during this period. X-rays revealed a pleural effusion. There was some cloudy density of both lungs. Age 33: The patient's weight was regular. The menses became somewhat irregular. Ages 34-38: During these years the weight was fairly stable. The patient was maintained on Dilantin. She was begun on IPPB (breathing therapy) whenever she would experience evidence of pneumonia. She would develop periocular edema which was treated with ointments. She underwent a cystoscopic examination for a neurogenic bladder. She developed several episodes of dermatitus. Her periods would occasionally be irregular with clots. Ages 39-40: She was occasionally fed small amounts of baby food which she would tolerate very poorly. Several episodes of febrile convulsions were noted. The patient had an excoriated coccygeal area (bedsores on the lower back). Age 40: No further attempts were made at oral feedings. The patient usually appeared to be very congested, requiring extensive and frequent oral suctioning. She had increasing convulsions. Age 42: The patient appeared to require constant care throughout the year, with many episodes of febrile convulsions and cyanosis. She developed a vaginal infection and the perineal area became excoriated. Age 43: The patient's weight appeared to be increasing and the diet was gradually decreased. She was getting IPPB three to four times a day. A small area of excoriation of the ear lobe was treated and the perineal and buttock rash cleared using various ointments. The patient began experiencing episodes of tremors and convulsions more frequently and required almost constant oral suctioning. Age 44: Occasionally she was given some diuretics during this time. The tremors persisted and increased in severity. Continual care with close observations was necessary. The menses became very scant and irregular. Age 45: The patient appeared to be retaining more body fluids. Her weight increased. Genito-urinary infection and tremors were increasing in severity. Abdominal breathing was noted and the respirations became extremely labored. The patient was maintained on oxygen, respiratory therapy and antibiotics. Urine output diminished. Her condition began to deteriorate rapidly and the patient expired. Robert E. Field, M.D., and Raymond J. Romanus, M.D., published in the Illinois Medical Journal and Connecticut Medicine. A RELIGIOUS VIEW:
VATICAN GUIDELINES
I F there are no other sufficient
remedies, it is permitted, with the
patient's consent, to have recourse to the means provided by the most advanced medical techniques, even if these means are still at the experimental stage and are not without a certain risk.
It is also permitted, with the patient's consent, to interrupt these means, where the results fall short of expectations. But for such a decision to be made, account will have to be taken of the reasonable wishes of the patient and the patient's family, as also of the advice of doctors who are specially competent in the matter. The latter may in particular judge that the investment in instruments and personnel is disproportionate to the results foreseen; they may also judge that the techniques applied impose on the patient strain or suffering out of proportion with the benefits which he or she may gain from such techniques.
It is also permissible to make do with the normal means that medicine can offer. Therefore one cannot impose on anyone the obligation to have recourse to a technique which is already in use but which carries a risk or is burdensome. Such refusal is not the equivalent of suicide; on the contrary, it should be considered as an acceptance of the human condition, or a wish to avoid the application of a medical procedure disproportionate to the results...or a desire not to impose excessive expense on the family or the community.
When inevitable death is imminent in spite of the means used, it is permitted in conscience to take the decision to refuse forms of treatment that would only secure a precarious and burdensome prolongation of life, so long as the normal care due to the sick person in similar cases is not interrupted.

446,The New York Times,"A recent British study showed, for example, that adult patients with cohesive family support tended to cope better with their disease, and those who coped better were likely to do better medically, even if their disabilities were more severe than those who coped poorly.
Researchers are understandably excited by recent genetic discoveries that could revolutionize the detection, prevention and correction of cystic fibrosis. In the last two months, several research teams from the United States, Canada and England have determined the location of the cystic fibrosis gene in the huge morass of a cell's genetic material. They discovered linkages between the gene and other known genes that could point to its presence.
Such genetic markers could be used in prenatal diagnosis; for example, to tell a mother of an existing cystic fibrosis child whether the disease affects the fetus of another child. Eventually, medical researchers may be able to isolate the gene, determine how it is abnormal and correct or compensate for that abnormality.
Still, all is far from rosy when it comes to cystic fibrosis. From various studies, Dr. Warwick estimates that perhaps two-thirds of children born with the disease die without it ever being properly diagnosed, not even at autopsy. (His studies, which try to account for undiagnosed cases, indicate that cystic fibrosis afflicts 1 child in 1,000 born in this country; others say the rate is 1 in 1,800.) For about half the children who are diagnosed as having the disease, the diagnosis is made relatively late, after age 1.
''For every year that goes by without a correct diagnosis and proper treatment, there's a decline in a child's chances of survival,'' Dr. Warwick said. What Is Cystic Fibrosis?
It is a disease that starves and strangles its victims. It attacks the exocrine glands, those that produce secretions that eventually leave the body. Included are the mucus-secreting glands of the respiratory and digestive tracts and the sweat glands. In victims of cystic fibrosis, these secretions are abnormally thick and concentrated. Instead of fluid secretions in the lungs that can trap invading organisms and particles and transport them out of harm's way, the gummy mucus blocks the movement of air through respiratory passages and is inept at battling infections.
Patients often have chronic coughs and must drink water all day long to keep respiratory secretions as loose as possible. They must also take antibiotics daily to suppress infections. Still, their lungs are highly susceptible to invasion by certain difficult-to-treat bacteria, particularly Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.",1985-12-18 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,ileus

They would not predict when he might be able to leave the hospital, but said that it could be as long as two more weeks.
In the governor's first seven days at NewYork-Presbyterian, doctors there did not make any public statements on his condition, and his staff members gave only cursory information. Yesterday, the surgeons spoke for the first time but were elusive in addressing certain key points.
They used the word ""peritonitis"" -- the name of a potentially fatal inflammation of the abdominal lining -- only after being pressed repeatedly by reporters. They also described abscesses but declined to use that word, and declined to say how high a fever Mr. Pataki had.

448,Personal Health; Gallbladder surgery is easier. Is it too common?,"The risk of recurrence is eliminated when the gallbladder is removed, either by open or laparoscopic surgery. Open cholecystectomy is one of the safest of major operations. It does, however, require general anesthesia, three to five days in the hospital and up to six weeks of recovery before life returns to normal. Postoperative pain is considerable, but the rate of complications and death is very low. A Simpler Procedure
In laparoscopic surgery, a small incision is made near the navel and three puncture holes are made under the rib cage to introduce a lighted scope and video camera and the operating tools. Carbon dioxide is pumped into the abdomen to separate abdominal muscles and fat from the underlying organs. Surgeons -- ideally, two working together -- watch a television monitor as they tie off the duct and artery feeding the gallbladder, free the gallbladder from its perch under the liver and slip the diseased organ out through the umbilical incision. Most of the carbon dioxide is then sucked out of the abdomen and the wounds are covered with the equivalent of Band-Aids.
The patient usually spends just one night in the hospital and can return to normal activities in three to five days, at most a week. The greatest discomfort is likely to be a day or so of abdominal cramps until the residual carbon dioxide is absorbed into the bloodstream.
Simple though it may sound, laparoscopic cholecystectomy is not innocuous. In fact, it has been associated with a higher than usual rate of injury to the bile duct, although this rate is still low -- one-tenth to two-tenths of 1 percent. The rate of inadvertent injury is typically higher in operations done by surgeons new to the procedure.
Sometimes, after starting a laparoscopic procedure, surgeons find it necessary to switch to an open cholecystectomy, for example, when the gallbladder cannot be freed from the liver or if stones are found unexpectedly in the common bile duct. Although many doctors believe that laparoscopic cholecystectomy is ideal for patients who are poor surgical risks, the occasional necessity to change midstream to the open operation suggests otherwise. Deciding on Surgery
For a vast majority of patients, the decision to undergo surgery should be based on recurring pain typical of gallbladder trouble followed by diagnostic tests showing the presence of obstructive stones or an inflamed gallbladder. Preventive surgery in patients free of symptoms but known to have gallstones is recommended for children, people with sickle cell disease and certain groups, like American Indians,who face an especially high risk of developing gallbladder cancer, an otherwise rare disease.
The pain of gallstones typically occurs in the upper right side of the abdomen, often after a big meal, and may spread to the right shoulder or other areas of the chest or abdomen. Gallstone pain is steady, usually lasting two to four hours and often peaking about midnight. If the gallbladder itself is inflamed, the pain can be severe and be accompanied by nausea, vomiting and fever.
People with such symptoms should first consult a general doctor, like an internist or gastroenterologist. The diagnostic workup should include an ultrasound examination. If tests indicate that surgery is warranted, ask to be referred to a surgeon highly experienced in doing laparoscopic cholecystectomies. The complication rate declines sharply as the surgeon's expertise rises.",1995-05-31 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,gallbladder

She had participated in oral arguments held by conference call on Tuesday morning, and the court said she planned to take part in Wednesday’s arguments by telephone from the hospital.
The court said Justice Ginsburg was treated for acute cholecystitis, a benign gallbladder condition, at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore. “Following oral arguments on Monday,” a statement from the court said, “the justice underwent outpatient tests at Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington, D.C., that confirmed she was suffering from a gallstone that had migrated to her cystic duct, blocking it and causing an infection.”
The treatment did not involve surgery, the statement said without elaboration. Gallstones can sometimes be removed through a scope passed down the digestive tract. If the blockage has caused an infection, it may be treated with antibiotics.

451,The Unusual Tale of the Roaming Gallstones,"“You have a mass in your chest, near your lung,” the voice on the phone said. The 71-year-old woman listened quietly as her doctor explained what the CT scan showed. The doctor suggested that she see a chest surgeon to figure out what it was and what they should do about it.
The woman wasn’t surprised to hear that she had a mass. That’s why she went to see her doctor in the first place. Weeks earlier, when she was rubbing her chronically aching back, she noticed that there was a subtle bulge between the next-to-last rib on her right side and the rib just above it. The mass felt hard, almost as if she was growing a new rib. And then it just kept growing. She went to see her doctor when the bulge was the size of an apricot.
[Watch ‘Diagnosis,’ a new show from The Times and Netflix.]
Her doctor ordered a chest X-ray. The woman was puzzled when her doctor called to tell her that the X-ray was completely normal. But when a physician assistant she had been seeing about dietary supplements looked at the film, he noticed that the scan hadn’t gone low enough to capture the mass. When the woman called her doctor back with that news, the doctor ordered a CT scan of the chest with contrast. That would show them what was there, the doctor assured her. It had, and now she needed a surgeon.
Finding a Doctor
When the woman told her daughter about the results of the CT scan and the doctor’s recommendations, her daughter immediately started searching for a surgeon. She found one at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. The woman called the surgeon’s office and sent over the imaging. The office said it would call with an appointment if the surgeon thought he could help. Four hours later, the office called back with an appointment — actually, two. The surgeon thought she should also see one of his colleagues. They were each surgeons specializing in sarcomas — the kind of tumors that grow in muscle and bone. But this second doctor operated on tumors in the abdomen and other areas. Although the mass was clearly in the back of the chest wall, it was located below the diaphragm, and so it was outside the area of the first surgeon’s expertise.",2019-09-11 09:00:02,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,gallbladder
452,THE DOCTOR'S WORLD; GALLSTONES REMOVED WITHOUT MAJOR SURGERY,"The gallbladder is a sac attached to the undersurface of the liver in the right upper portion of the abdomen, just below the rib cage. The sac retains the bile formed by the liver until it is needed to help in digestion.
Gallstones often irritate the lining of the gallbladder, producing inflammation and pain that can be severe and can last several hours. Gallstones can lead to a variety of symptoms such as belching, nausea, vomiting and an aching pain that typically occurs in the abdomen just below the breastbone. Sometimes the pain moves to the right upper side of the abdomen, or around the sides to the back or shoulder, or straight through the body to the upper back.
Gallstones can become dangerous when they escape from the gallbladder to lodge in the outflow tubes known as the cystic and common bile ducts. An errant stone can block the drainage of bile from the gallbladder into the small intestine.
Gallstones can lead to another complication, pancreatitis, which is a potentially fatal condition involving inflammation of the pancreas, the gland that produces several digestive substances.
Because gallbladder attacks can recur unpredictably and sometimes can lead to potentially fatal complications, the standard treatment has been surgery. However, in recent years many people have chosen to take chenodiol pills as a way of dissolving gallstones without surgery. But dissolution with these pills is not always successful and, when it is, it usually takes from one to three years. Diarrhea is a common side effect. Moreover, 25 percent to 50 percent of those who take chenodiol form gallstones again 5 to 10 years later.
The lithotripter machine that has been so effective in shattering kidney stones has not had the same success in crushing gallstones, the Mayo Clinic doctors say, because it breaks gallstones into fragments that often cannot be passed out of the gallbladder and their total dissolution would require additional treatment with ether solvent or other chemicals.
Dr. Thistle, a pioneer in developing chenodiol therapy, explored other approaches because of the drug's drawbacks. He reviewed the articles doctors have written about the many solvents they have tested. Doctors have long known that conventional ether is a good solvent for cholesterol gallstones, but they abandoned attempts to use it for such therapy because diethyl ether turns into a potentially explosive gas at body temperature.",1985-09-17 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,gallbladder
453,Doctors Try New Surgery for Gallbladder Removal,"But she also said, “I give them a lot of credit for trying new things.”
Dr. Walter E. Longo, a professor of surgery at Yale, said that the technique was “extremely experimental” and that there was no information yet about whether it would work as well or be as safe as conventional laparoscopic surgery. If the natural-orifice approach is to gain acceptance, it will have to measure up to the standard technique in a study, he said.
Dr. Longo also said he thought the new technique would be limited to relatively small operations like taking out the gallbladder or appendix, or exploring the abdomen to assess pain or determine the stage of a cancer.
“I think we’re all sort of waiting to see how safe it is and how it’s accepted, and above all to make sure it doesn’t do any harm to patients,” Dr. Longo said.
At Stanford, Dr. Myriam J. Curet, a professor of surgery, said, “It has some promise, and there’s a lot of interest in the surgical community, a lot of attention being paid to it as a wave of the future.”
Dr. Curet acknowledged that the idea was a bit disturbing at first, and said that even an audience of doctors shuddered at the video of the appendix being pulled out through the patient’s mouth. But if the recovery does turn out to be quicker and less painful than the current methods allow, patients might want the procedure, including women in whom it would be performed vaginally.
Dr. Bessler said his patient agreed to the procedure (two others had declined) because he told her he thought it would have advantages for her, and she accepted his judgment. She was the first in a study that is to include 100 women who need gallbladder surgery, appendectomies or biopsies taken from inside the abdomen. All the procedures will be done through the vagina.
Dr. Dennis Fowler, another surgeon who participated in the operation, said the team began experimenting on women because “incisions in the vagina have been used for a variety of procedures for decades, and proved safe with no long-term consequences.”",2007-04-20 04:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,gallbladder
454,"In experiment, doctors remove gallbladder through vagina","Doctors in New York have removed a woman's gallbladder with instruments passed through her vagina, a technique they hope will cause less pain and scarring than the usual operation and allow a quicker recovery. The technique can eliminate the need to cut through abdominal muscles, a major source of pain after surgery.
The operation was experimental, part of a study that is being done to find out whether people will fare better if abdominal surgery is performed through natural openings in the body rather than cuts in the belly. The surgery still requires cutting, through the wall of the vagina, stomach or colon, but doctors say it should hurt less because those tissues are far less sensitive than the abdominal muscles.
Interest in this idea heightened after doctors from India made a video in 2004 showing an appendix being taken out through a patient's mouth. The patient had abdominal scars that would have made conventional surgery difficult.
The New York patient, who is 66, had her gallbladder removed on March 21 and is recovering well, said her surgeon, Dr. Marc Bessler, the director of laparoscopic surgery at Columbia University Medical Center. Bessler said he thought it was the first time the operation had been performed in the United States, and he plans to show a video of the operation at a gastroenterology meeting in Las Vegas on Sunday.",2007-04-20 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,gallbladder

456,"The Damage of Reflux (Bile, Not Acid)","No one with bile reflux needs to just wait for worse to come, although the remedies are not as simple and well known as they are for acid reflux. The condition usually can be managed with medications, but severe cases may require surgery.
Image
Symptoms and Causes
Both acid reflux and bile reflux may afflict the same person, which can make diagnosis a challenge. But the stomach inflammation that results from bile reflux often causes a burning or gnawing pain in the upper abdomen that is not felt with acid reflux, according to experts at the Mayo Clinic. Other symptoms of bile reflux may include frequent heartburn (the main symptom of acid reflux), nausea, vomiting bile, sometimes a cough or hoarseness and unintended weight loss.
A brief anatomy lesson makes the problem easier to understand. The main organs of the digestive tract are separated by valvelike tissues that, when functioning properly, allow food and digestive fluids to pass in only one direction: down. Thus, as food and liquids pass through the digestive process, they normally travel from the mouth to the throat, then down the esophagus into the stomach, and finally into the small intestine. The opening between the esophagus and stomach, a muscular ring called the lower esophageal sphincter, is meant to keep stomach acid from backing up. When it malfunctions, acid reflux  chronic heartburn  is the usual result.
Likewise, the pyloric valve, the muscular ring between the stomach and small intestine, is supposed to open just enough to permit a fraction of an ounce of liquefied food to pass into the small intestine, but not enough to allow bile to back up into the stomach. When this valve fails to close properly, refluxed bile can cause gastritis, an irritation and inflammation of the stomach lining. Untreated, that can result in a bleeding ulcer or even stomach cancer.
If the esophageal sphincter malfunctions at the same time, or there is a build-up of pressure in the stomach, bile and acid can reach the lower portion of the esophagus, inflaming the delicate lining of this organ. If the problem persists, it can cause scarring that narrows the esophagus, which may result in choking, or the cellular abnormality called Barrett’s esophagus, which can become precancerous and eventually develop into cancer that is nearly always fatal.
Gastroenterologists have recently demonstrated that Barrett’s esophagus can often be effectively treated with radiofrequency therapy, which might help patients like Mrs. Kozma.
Bile reflux can occur as a complication of certain surgeries, like the gallbladder surgery Mrs. Kozma underwent. More often, though, damage to the pyloric valve results from gastric surgery  total removal of the stomach or the gastric bypass operation used to treat morbid obesity.",2009-06-29 20:53:36,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,gallbladder
457,Chinese Bear Bile Farming Draws Charges of Cruelty,"To the distress of its opponents, the industry has grown significantly in the 13 years since Chinese officials first pledged to gradually reduce the number of captive bears to 1,500 from 7,000. These days, there are an estimated 20,000 bears on nearly 100 domestic bear farms, an expansion fueled in part by marketing efforts promoting novel uses for bear bile, like a hangover cure for well-to-do businessmen who engage in nightly carousing.
Besides China, there are bear bile farms in Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar and North Korea.
For animal welfare advocates, the challenge is to convince Chinese consumers that the barbarity of bile farming outweighs the supposed medicinal benefits of natural bile — or that the risks of consuming bile from sick bears pumped with antibiotics are high.
In addition to circulating videos of harvesting practices, organizations like Animals Asia wield a number of secret weapons, including Sun Li, Caesar and Buddha. They are among the 158 rescued bears that roam the group’s sanctuary outside Chengdu. The center receives school groups, celebrities and Chinese reporters, all of whom are invariably smitten with the bears.
Most of the animals came from farms closed by the authorities because they had fewer than 50 bears, a violation of industry rules. The bulk of the animals are Asiatic black bears, a threatened species better known as the moon bear for the distinctive white crescent that arcs across its chest.",2013-05-21 23:44:04,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,gallbladder
458,"On Alex Trebek’s Final ‘Jeopardy!,’ a Last Introduction From a Friend","Next week “Jeopardy!” will return with Gilbert introducing a new name: Ken Jennings, a record-breaking former contestant, who will be the first in a series of new, interim hosts.
“It was a very bizarre feeling,” Gilbert, 92, said in an interview on Wednesday. “I have never thought of anyone as host of the show except Alex.”
After Trebek’s death, Gilbert, who has had a roughly 70-year career in entertainment, said that he wondered whether it was the right time to leave. At that point, because of the pandemic, he had not been working at the studio, in Culver City, Calif., but had been recording his announcements from a bedroom in his Venice Beach home.
“I thought, ‘Gee, can I go on doing this? Can I still do what the show needs?’” he said. “And I decided, yes, I would go on. I would go on because Alex wanted the show to go on.”
When Trebek died at age 80 in November after battling Stage 4 pancreatic cancer, the show’s producers made clear that there would be no rush to fill the role of a man who had been the face and voice of “Jeopardy!” for so long. Only 10 days before his death, Trebek had been in the studio filming, and the show had enough episodes to finish the year. Instead of finishing in the last week of 2020, a chaotic week for television and for viewers, the show decided to push Trebek’s final five episodes to this week.",2021-01-07 16:26:35,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,gilbert

He was 94.
John Mulholland, a longtime friend and co-worker, confirmed the death.
Mr. Gilbert spent most of his final decades living alone in a small apartment on Jane Street, relying on money he had inherited from his parents. “An American Family” was the last film he made.
But in the early 1970s he was the envy of many documentarians, having produced well-received films about the anthropologist Margaret Mead and the disabled Irish writer Christy Brown.
He was a producer at WNET, the New York public television outlet, when he came up with an even more ambitious idea, at a time when narrative journalism was on the rise: to follow a real American family for months, capturing moments mundane and emotional in an unvarnished, unrehearsed style known as cinéma vérité.",2020-04-13 20:36:51,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,gilbert

Nearly five years ago, Thomas Gilbert Jr. showed up unannounced at his parents’ Midtown Manhattan apartment and asked to speak alone with his father about business.
Minutes later, his father, a hedge fund manager, lay dead with a gunshot to his head and Mr. Gilbert was running from the police .
As details emerged, the murder stunned New York’s high society, in which the Gilberts were well known. The police said Mr. Gilbert, a Princeton graduate who was never able to obtain consistent employment, had killed his 70-year-old father because his weekly $1,000 allowance was cut. He became a symbol of ungrateful greed, a child of privilege who turned to murder when he feared he was losing his lavish lifestyle.
A jury found Mr. Gilbert, 35, guilty of second-degree murder and gun charges in late June, rejecting an insanity defense.

462,"Jack Gilbert, a Poet Off the Literary Grid, Dies at 87","Jack Gilbert, a poet whose frank, forthright, emotionally fraught works observed the grand universal realities of love and death from a perspective off the literary grid, died on Tuesday in Berkeley, Calif. He was 87.
The cause was complications of pneumonia, said Henry Lyman, a friend who had rented a room to Mr. Gilbert for many years in his house in Northampton, Mass. Mr. Gilbert’s publisher, Alfred A. Knopf, said he had Alzheimer’s disease.
Mr. Gilbert, who won the Yale Younger Poets Prize in 1962 for his first book, “Views of Jeopardy,” and the National Book Critics Circle Award in 2005 for his fourth, “Refusing Heaven,” was a peculiar figure in the contemporary poetry world in the sense that he wasn’t exactly in it. A restless man who traveled a great deal, lived frugally and occasionally lectured or taught to support himself, he spoke and wrote with enthusiasm about life in the world, without failing to acknowledge its terrors and miseries.
Famous for eschewing fame, he did not go to writers’ conferences or cocktail parties, gave readings sporadically and did not publish a great deal, either. His output over a half-century included a mere five slim volumes; his “Collected Poems,” which Knopf brought out earlier this year, squeezed the entire oeuvre into 400 pages. Reviewing it in The New York Times, Dwight Garner called it “a revelation, almost certainly among the two or three most important books of poetry that will be published this year.”",2012-11-15 03:48:32,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,gilbert

He realized, he said, that under the stress and emotion of the trials the defendants would be particularly anxious to talk, expecially to one who understood their language and was willing to listen.
Making mental notes on those conversations and later writing down those notes in a telegraphic style, he composed a day‐to‐day account of these sessions a day‐to‐day account of these sessions that was published in 1947 as “The Nuremberg Diary.”
A Book on Dictatorship
A book entitled “The Psychology of Dictatorship,” based on an examination of the leaders of Nazi Germany, was published by Dr. Gilbert in 1950. It was based on a year of daily contact with seven top German leaders and included a personality study of Hitler.
After the trials, Dr. Gilbert accepted an associate professorship in psychology at. Princeton University. He was there until 1950.

464,"He Graduated From Princeton, but Barely Worked. Then He Killed His Dad Over His Allowance.","Though Mr. Gilbert’s courtroom tantrums may have given the jury the impression that he’s mentally unstable, not everyone saw him as a mentally disturbed man in the months leading up to his father’s murder.
Two ex-girlfriends and his uncle described him in testimony as “shy” and “awkward,” but said they did not see signs of severe mental illness, nor did they think he was a murderer in the making.
The witnesses said Mr. Gilbert seemed more concerned with maintaining an easy going lifestyle than following his father’s footsteps. His father, who attended Princeton and Harvard Business School, went into finance and founded Wainscott Capital Partners Fund.
His uncle, George Seymour Beckwith Gilbert, a merchant banker living in Connecticut, testified that he had spoken to his younger brother about Mr. Gilbert’s lack of ambition. He said he felt he had a right to speak up because he had paid for his nephew’s Princeton tuition.
“I said he ought to get a job,” he testified. “That’s the way we were brought up,” he added. “We always worked summers after we were 16. And we were expected to get a job when we got out of school.”
Yet the younger Mr. Gilbert seemed unconcerned with making his own way, his uncle said while trying to keep a steady tone of voice. He said his nephew did not reply to emails that included suggestions about job opportunities.

465,Elizabeth Gilbert’s ‘City of Girls’ Delivers a Love- and Booze-Filled Romp Through 1940s New York,"When Vivian’s aunt finally has a hit show — called “City of Girls” — Gilbert replicates notices in the styles of Brooks Atkinson, Heywood Broun and Walter Winchell, and an excerpt from a New Yorker profile of its star by Alexander Woollcott. Her evocation of the bygone theater world suggests such backstage movie classics as “Stage Door” and “42nd Street” — and perhaps the Crummles theater company in “Nicholas Nickleby” — and her bygone theater people talk just like bygone theater people: “Very much of little consequence has transpired since last we met, my dear. Let’s sit down for a drink and talk about none of it.” “But of course he’s a playboy, darling. What handsome man worth his salt is not?” In fact, one of them echoes the well-known advice — “The customers out there want to like you. Always remember that, kid” — that the old pro Bebe Daniels gives to the tremulous Ruby Keeler: “Remember that this audience didn’t come here tonight because they want to hate you. They came because they want to love you.”
The tumults of fun die down after Vivian misbehaves, in one bed, with a showgirl and the husband of a revered actress, and then has to absorb a wide tonal palette of verbal abuse: from the slang-slinging Winchell in person (“Getting tangled up with somebody’s bum husband and a hot-to-trot lezzie — that’s no way for a girl from a good family to live”), from the imperious actress herself (“You will never be a person of the slightest significance”) and from the man who drives her back home in disgrace to upstate New York (“dirty little whore”).
Image
This is the halfway point of the book, after which Vivian’s real life begins — and the narrative slackens. “The years passed,” she tells us. Later, “The years passed like they always do.” She goes back to New York, sets up as a maker of bridal gowns, lives platonically with her female business partner, finds the love of her life — a World War II veteran whose PTSD precludes any physical contact with her — and has no-strings sexual escapades with a variety of other men, notable only for the vagueness of the impressions they leave. One is “an absolute lamb”; another is “so dear and attractive.” The inevitable bad patches are equally vague. When “things got rougher and more dicey than I might have preferred … I rode it out like an experienced sailor in a bad squall. I don’t know how else to explain it.” O.K., fine: Vivian doesn’t claim to be a writer.
Although she is purportedly writing this apologia for her long life, in the present day, as an “ancient woman still tottering around New York City, absolutely refusing to abandon either her life or her real estate.” It’s addressed to someone named Angela, whom she hardly knows — the reader has no idea who she is — and who’s written to ask about Vivian’s relations with “my father.” Vivian doesn’t get around to identifying Angela’s father until Page 400, when a hitherto nameless minor character takes center stage, but Angela’s inquiry is more than just a contrived prompt. Vivian’s rambling recollections eventually reveal a hidden coherence: The novel turns out to be the self-portrait of a woman whose truest intimacy is with her own being. “There was a place within my imagination so fathomlessly deep that the light of the real world could never touch it. … Friendship could not reach it. … Awe and joy could not reach it. This hidden part of me could only be reached through sexual intercourse. And when a man went to that darkest, secret place within me, I felt as though I had landed in the very beginning of myself.” Mystical narcissism? Or radical honesty about the limits of human relationships.",2019-06-01 09:00:06,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,gilbert

The couple went with Chelsea and went with new, buying a floor-through loft that Ms. Gottfried initially painted yellow from stem to stern. “It was a big deal that we were moving in together,” she said. “We were nervous. So I thought yellow for sunshine. I figured I’d do everything else later.”
Credit Benjamin Moore. It all worked out. They married in 2007 and had two children, Lily, now 7, and Max, now 5. Living with toddlers, “you don’t want to make things too nice, because they destroy everything,” said Ms. Gottfried, who waited and bided her time. Last year she prodded her husband: The loft really needed a face-lift. Six months ago, the couple got serious about decorating. That is, Ms. Gottfried got serious about decorating. And Mr. Gottfried, who shares George Carlin’s belief that home is just a place to keep your stuff, got out of the way.
“People move into places and tear down walls and they put the bathroom where the kitchen was and the bedroom where the living room was,” he said. “That stuff confuses me no end. To make two bedrooms out of one large bedroom, my wife said there was a place you could rent a wall. That sounded insane to me. I thought, ‘Are people going to break in here at some point and say, “We’re taking our wall back”? ’”
For the record, no walls were harmed in the remaking of this apartment, which combines warmth (a sectional upholstered in washable velvet; a wood dining table and buffet) and sleek functionality (polished chrome coffee table, reproduction Eames lounger), and mixes the classic (crown moldings) with the contemporary (an angular light fixture over the dining room table).
Certain practicalities did have to be taken into account. Mr. Gottfried is a hoarder of no mean talent. His collections include but are not limited to T-shirts from the first Reagan administration; travel-size deodorants and tubes of toothpaste from hotels around the world and bars of soap from several now defunct airlines. He does not take kindly to things being thrown out. Accordingly, Ms. Gottfried had a banquette built with storage underneath the benches. Spillover can be accommodated in the living room wall unit. For decades, a binder kept under the bed held Mr. Gottfried’s artwork: sheet after sheet filled with little faces.

In January, at the Largo comedy club in Los Angeles, Ms. Gilbert and Mr. Bell chicken-danced and mugged to “Can’t Stop,” the Red Hot Chili Peppers song, for what seemed like an eternity, a move designed to last, as Ms. Gilbert put it, “long past when it’s appropriate and so much that it becomes awkward.”
Such unabashed behavior, Mr. Bell suggested recently, is what draws people in. “So much around us is styled and Instagrammed within an inch of its life,” he wrote in an email, “but for she and I this is where the life, the juice, the mojo, the szoosh — whatever that word is that Liz uses — is. I’ve often felt like my job was to grow in public. I sense that in Liz as well. To search for the water and try to describe where we found it.”
The epigraph of “Eat Pray Love” is “Tell the truth, tell the truth, tell the truth!” — an exhortation to Ms. Gilbert delivered by Sheryl Louise Moller, an actress and old friend, when Ms. Gilbert, pre-“Eat,” had embarked on the affair that would end her first marriage.
“She wrote this book that she thought maybe 60 people would read,” Ms. Moller said. “It was like a diary, a purge. Then I watched her become this person that Oprah would have on her show. Liz is an old-school storyteller: When she tells a story about you, you sit slack-jawed at the epic-ness of your own tale. I watched her become this person who could get up on stage and tell people what they needed to hear. And connect with those readers. I watched her become the patron saint of any author who’s been hugely successful and had to write the next thing. She knows what it’s like to be overwhelmed by fame. She is absolutely committed to the act of creation, which is why she is able to start again, over and over again.”
At 13 years and counting, how tiresome is it for Ms. Gilbert to keep answering questions about “Eat Pray Love”?

468,"At Gene Therapy's Frontier, the Amish Build a Clinic","A Mission
Doctor Draws Others To Help the Children
Dr. Blaese and other researchers, leaders in genetics and disorders involving bilirubin, were drawn to Lancaster County largely through the efforts of Dr. Holmes Morton, a slight, graying man of 49 who still speaks with the twang of his native West Virginia.
A Harvard-trained pediatrician, Dr. Morton first encountered Amish youngsters with genetic diseases while he was working at a Philadelphia hospital in the 1980's. He had trained in biochemical genetics, and he recognized that some of the children had metabolic disorders, not previously diagnosed, that could be managed with specific diets and careful treatment of minor illnesses. But without proper therapy, the diseases could rapidly cause brain damage. Some parents whose children had died or become handicapped sought his help for younger siblings.
''I knew I could take care of them,'' Dr. Morton said.
In 1988, he began commuting to Lancaster County, driving from one house call to another. A year later, he and his wife, Caroline, and their three children moved to Strasburg. Dr. Morton was 39, and highly regarded by his colleagues, including some who were dismayed to see him put aside a bright future in science and academia to disappear into a small town and treat children with obscure diseases.
But where others saw a backwater, Dr. Morton saw a need and an opportunity to make a difference, to develop treatments for diseases that were taking a cruel toll on children. In 1990, he opened his nonprofit clinic. And rather than disappearing from the research world, he brought it to Lancaster County. ''I think of myself as a pediatrician who knows a little more than average about biochemistry and genetics, and can use that in a primary care setting to prevent problems,'' he said.
His patients think of him in another way: ''He is a gift to us,'' said Miriam Martin of Mifflinburg, Pa., whose three young children are all under his care for Crigler-Najjar syndrome.
For generations, the Amish and Mennonites, descendants of Swiss and German Anabaptists who settled in Pennsylvania in the 1700's, have suffered from unusually high rates of dozens of genetic disorders. The diseases occur because the communities arose from a small population of founders, and members -- who are forbidden to marry outside their religion -- marry each other. As a result, many people in the groups today are related, increasing the odds that both members of a couple will unknowingly be carriers of a hereditary disease that does not affect them but will show up in their children.
Scientists have eagerly studied the Amish for decades, making discoveries that filled at least one textbook on genetic disorders. But the experts who gathered their data from Lancaster County did not stay to take care of the diseases they identified.",1999-06-29 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,crigler-najjar syndrome
469,A Disturbing Approach,"To the Editor:
It is disturbing that the Amish community, which forgoes modern technology, now seems to embrace genetic experiments as a treatment for Crigler-Najjar syndrome, a fatal genetic disease afflicting their children (''At Gene Therapy's Frontier, the Amish Build a Clinic,'' June 29).
This inherited genetic disorder could be prevented by prenatal diagnosis, or avoided by relaxing the religious rule that encourages Amish members to marry inside their small community, thereby increasing the odds of having children with this disease.
Seeking expensive, extreme, high-tech genetic interventions for preventable diseases illustrates the fundamental wrongs of a community that puts its religious practices ahead of the welfare of their children. Children should not have to endure predictable suffering and premature death for the sake of their parents' religious practices.

470,A Doctor for the Future,"Through immersion he has come to understand that the devastation of metabolic disorders like GA1 is not inevitable, as had once been thought. If you can keep the child healthy for the first 24 months of life, the time of the greatest brain development, Morton has learned, you can probably keep him healthy for life. Strict monitoring from birth of the ingestion of protein can keep glutaric acid from accumulating and becoming toxic. But even if the child does go ""into crisis,"" does get a cold or flu, etc., Morton has also learned to take immediate action to limit the transformation from healthy to helpless. ""We've developed strategies for rescuing children when they get sick,"" he says, including immediate infusions of sugar to keep patients from losing oxygen, and an amino-acid derivative, carnitine, that helps the brain reverse the buildup of excess glutaric acid. The clinic has taken to giving parties for 2-year-old GA1 patients because ""it truly is a new birth day,"" Morton says. He does not get every patient past the danger zone, but he certainly saves more lives than before. When he first arrived in Lancaster, 95 percent of the GA1 children he treated were physically and cognitively devastated. Now only 25 percent are.
While he was fine-tuning clinical treatment, Morton was also filling in genetic informational gaps. During the 1990's, scientists throughout the world identified a variety of different mutations, or genetic glitches, that can cause GA1. In 1996, by comparing the DNA of his affected patients with the range of possible mutations found to cause the disease, Morton determined which mutation all his patients shared. Now known as ""the Amish mutation,"" it is also found in patients in areas of Europe where the ancestors of his patients once lived. Morton has come to know the genes that cause other Plain People diseases too. Some he discovered himself -- like the gene for one cause of sudden infant death syndrome common in the Amish. Others he did not discover but narrowed down -- like the gene for maple syrup urine disease, which got its name because sugars thrown off by the body give patients' urine a distinctly sweet smell. M.S.U.D. is effectively the Mennonite version of GA1 -- similar symptoms, similar inability to digest certain proteins, but found among Mennonites rather than the Amish. It can be caused by a variety of genes and mutations, and in 1994 Morton determined which of these specifically afflicted his Mennonite patients.
Such knowledge fortified his treatment arsenal. All of Morton's Mennonite M.S.U.D. patients have the same mutation for the disease, and theirs is the most lethal version possible; their bodies do not produce any of the enzyme required to break down proteins properly. But not all his M.S.U.D. patients are Mennonite. About 15 percent of his practice consists of non-Plain families who have traveled to Lancaster from 27 states and more than a dozen countries, learning of his work through the word-of-mouth and Web-based communities that grow up around any disease. These patients often have less-lethal versions of the mutation, a fact that is verifiable only once you can read their genes. Morton recently began treating a 14-year-old girl whose family is not Mennonite but was originally from Puerto Rico and who has a milder form of M.S.U.D. in that her body produces some of the critical enzyme. The girl can eat three times as much protein as the Mennonite children, which makes a world of difference to her every day.
For a brief moment, Morton thought he could cure at least some of his patients. The year was 1999, and the disease was Crigler-Najjar syndrome, a liver-enzyme deficiency that allows a lethal buildup of bilirubin in the blood. It was first discovered in 1952 by Dr. Victor Najjar and Dr. John Crigler, who was a professor of Morton's at Harvard Medical School. Crigler-Najjar children become severely jaundiced and must sleep under hot, bright, blue-toned lights to break down the bilirubin. Eventually, though, even the lights don't work, and the condition causes brain damage or death. There are about 90 known cases in the country, and 25 of those are Amish or Mennonite. Nearly all of those are Morton's patients.
The field of gene therapy had existed for only a decade when, in June 1999, Morton invited many of those patients to a conference at a local inn. There the families learned of a new delivery system for genetic repair. Until that point, scientists had been experimenting with a method using viruses to transport DNA into the body, hoping that the viruses would insert themselves into cell structure and that the replacement DNA would correct the gene mutation. The new theory introduced at the 1999 meeting was called chimeraplasty, and rather than relying on viruses, it used a molecule called a chimeraplast -- a manufactured mix of DNA and RNA -- to trigger the system's cells to repair themselves.
The most notable moment came when Morton announced that the first human trials of the new approach would be on three of his Crigler-Najjar patients. The company that had developed the chimera technology would ask the F.D.A. for permission to test it on humans in the fall. ""I really thought we would start treatment in six months,"" he says now. ""I believed it would happen.""
What happened instead was that two months after the conference, in September 1999, an 18-year-old Arizonan named Jesse Gelsinger died during a gene-therapy trial at the University of Pennsylvania. Gelsinger was not a Crigler-Najjar patient, and the trial in question used viruses, not chimeraplasts, but the field came to a complete halt for several years and has still not recovered. The company that was to conduct the Crigler-Najjar trials was sold to a French firm, and the scientists who had brought hope to Morton's patients moved on to other things.",2005-11-06 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,crigler-najjar syndrome
471,Gene Therapy's Focus Shifts From Rare Illnesses,"WHEN the gene responsible for Hunter's syndrome was discovered about 10 years ago, Joan Cohen was told by a doctor that it would take only five years to develop a gene therapy for the rare hereditary disease that afflicts her son.
Mrs. Cohen, who lives in Island Park, L.I., is still waiting. Even in its mild form, the disease often kills people by the time they reach 35. ''It's like a time bomb,'' Mrs. Cohen said. Her 17-year-old son, Adam, is just 4 feet 11 inches tall and suffers from leaky and enlarged heart valves, respiratory problems and deteriorated hearing. ''I'm sitting here with a kid that I know is going to die and there's nothing I can do that will stop it.''
When it first made headlines about a decade ago, gene therapy seemed the answer to the prayers of thousands of people affected by hereditary diseases. The idea is simple and eloquent. Many inherited diseases are caused by a faulty gene, which makes the body unable to produce some essential protein or enzyme. Gene therapy would deliver the needed gene to a person's cells, which would then begin producing the essential substance.
But gene therapy so far has not worked, mainly because it has been difficult to get the genes to the desired cells efficiently and have them produce enough of the needed protein. Scientific evidence of consistent improvement in patients is lacking so far, although some patients have reported gains.",1998-08-04 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,crigler-najjar syndrome

For decades, scientists have been mystified by a significant portion of hepatitis cases that were not caused by any of the liver disease's main known viral agents, hepatitis A through E. But now, acting on a hunch that unidentified viruses might be found in the blood of AIDS patients because of their weakened immune systems, Dr. Daniele Primi, an Italian scientist, has obtained what he and other scientists said in interviews was strong evidence for a novel hepatitis virus.
Dr. Primi, who works in Brescia at a research laboratory for Diasorin, a medical biotechnology company, has not submitted a paper for publication in a peer-reviewed scientific journal and has yet to obtain proof from a photograph of the virus through an electron microscope. Details of the research are included in the patent applications Diasorin filed in 1998 for discovery of the virus and development of tests, Dr. Primi said.
Still, other researchers are picking up on the early findings. Using an unusual technique to test nearly 600 stored blood samples, largely from the laboratory of Dr. Harvey Alter at the National Institutes of Health, Dr. Primi's team linked the newly found virus to cases of hepatitis with unexplained viral causes.

He was 98 .
The death, at a care facility, was confirmed by his daughter Lisa Enslow .
Dr. Thorbjarnarson was one of the foremost experts on surgeries of the biliary tract — involving the liver, gall bladder and bile ducts — when he was called to remove Warhol’s infected gallbladder in 1987 at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, where he worked for virtually his entire career.

Dr. Thorbjarnarson (who pronounced his surname thor-bee-ON-a-son so that it would be easier for his American colleagues to master) completed the operation on Warhol without incident, and Warhol seemed stable as he recovered in a private hospital room. But his condition deteriorated overnight, and he died in the early hours of Feb. 22 at 58. At the time, many newspapers characterized the operation as “routine.”

481,M'ARTHUR WILL GET TEST SURGERY TODAY,"WASHINGTON. March 5 (AP) — General of the Army Douglas MacArthur will undergo an exploratory operation tomorrow to determine the cause of anobstruction in his biliary tract system.
The top surgeon in the case, Lieut. Gen. Leonard D. Heaton, Surgeon General of the Army, said that cancer could not be ruled out as a possibility, especially in an 84‐year‐old patient.
The biliary tract is a system of ducts carrying bile—a fluid needed for digestion—from both the gall bladder and the liver. A blockage or constriction within the system of channels —or even in small channels within the liver feeding into it—can cause a backing up of bile into the bloodstream. This results in a yellowing of the skin and body fluids, called jaundice.
General MacArthur had been exhibiting moderately severe jaundice for several months before he entered the Walter Reed Army Medical Center on Monday for “observation and evaluation of abdominal complaints.”",1964-03-06 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,biliary tract

Image
Symptoms and Causes
Both acid reflux and bile reflux may afflict the same person, which can make diagnosis a challenge. But the stomach inflammation that results from bile reflux often causes a burning or gnawing pain in the upper abdomen that is not felt with acid reflux, according to experts at the Mayo Clinic. Other symptoms of bile reflux may include frequent heartburn (the main symptom of acid reflux), nausea, vomiting bile, sometimes a cough or hoarseness and unintended weight loss.
A brief anatomy lesson makes the problem easier to understand. The main organs of the digestive tract are separated by valvelike tissues that, when functioning properly, allow food and digestive fluids to pass in only one direction: down. Thus, as food and liquids pass through the digestive process, they normally travel from the mouth to the throat, then down the esophagus into the stomach, and finally into the small intestine. The opening between the esophagus and stomach, a muscular ring called the lower esophageal sphincter, is meant to keep stomach acid from backing up. When it malfunctions, acid reflux  chronic heartburn  is the usual result.
Likewise, the pyloric valve, the muscular ring between the stomach and small intestine, is supposed to open just enough to permit a fraction of an ounce of liquefied food to pass into the small intestine, but not enough to allow bile to back up into the stomach. When this valve fails to close properly, refluxed bile can cause gastritis, an irritation and inflammation of the stomach lining. Untreated, that can result in a bleeding ulcer or even stomach cancer.
If the esophageal sphincter malfunctions at the same time, or there is a build-up of pressure in the stomach, bile and acid can reach the lower portion of the esophagus, inflaming the delicate lining of this organ. If the problem persists, it can cause scarring that narrows the esophagus, which may result in choking, or the cellular abnormality called Barrett’s esophagus, which can become precancerous and eventually develop into cancer that is nearly always fatal.
Gastroenterologists have recently demonstrated that Barrett’s esophagus can often be effectively treated with radiofrequency therapy, which might help patients like Mrs. Kozma.
Bile reflux can occur as a complication of certain surgeries, like the gallbladder surgery Mrs. Kozma underwent. More often, though, damage to the pyloric valve results from gastric surgery  total removal of the stomach or the gastric bypass operation used to treat morbid obesity.",2009-06-29 20:53:36,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,biliary tract

The hospital's statement came after demonstrations against the Shah during the weekend in New York and on a day when Iranian students in Teheran continued to hold scores of hostages they seized Sunday in the United States Embassy. The students demanded that the United States return the Shah to Iran.
A Federal magistrate in Manhattan yesterday released on $500 bond the seven anti‐Shah demonstrators who were arrested Sunday at the Statue of Liberty.
Magistrate Harold J. Raby imposed the bond after a 45‐minute hearing at the United States District Court in Foley Square.

Five of the demonstrators were students from Iran and two were American citizens.

""All I know is that I throw up whenever I eat, but all the tests say that nothing is wrong. I just don't know anymore."" The exhausted 26-year-old looked up at the doctor expectantly. Her colorful barrettes and the dark smudges under her eyes gave her the appearance of an irritable child.
Dr. Stanley Ottinger listened attentively. She seemed thinner and paler than when he saw her three months before. During that visit, she also complained of nausea -- a symptom she attributed to the birth-control ring he had previously prescribed for her. The device, a plastic ring that, like the more common patch, secretes estrogen, was removed by the patient a few weeks before. The nausea remained. Her earlier exam revealed nothing unusual but some tenderness in the right upper quadrant of her abdomen. Ottinger had sent her for an ultrasound to look for gallstones. None were found. Initially, the nausea was intermittent -- now it was every day. Eating anything triggered spasms and heaving. She didn't have diarrhea or pain -- just continuous nausea and vomiting.
After she had stopped using birth control, she went to her primary-care doctor, who thought she might be pregnant. (She wasn't.) She had seen a gastroenterologist and a surgeon. She had been started on half a dozen medicines -- several to stop the nausea, another to speed up her digestion, a third to reduce her stomach acid. She had had tests: two to look for gallstones; a barium swallow and a CT scan to look for blockages; she had even had a tiny camera put into her stomach to look for ulcers. Her blood was sent to check her liver and pancreas. Her stomach was tested for a bacterium that causes ulcers. Everything was normal. ""I'm losing my faith in doctors,"" she said. ""It seems like everyone's attitude is: 'I don't know what it is. Try this pill and call me next week.' They think it's all in my head. Do you?""
2. Investigation The doctor wasn't sure what to think. As an OB-GYN, Ottinger saw a lot of nausea, but the cause was usually obvious.

488,Test Indicates New Vaccine Works Against Hepatitis A,"Dr. Miriam Alter, chief of the epidemiology section of the hepatitis branch at the Centers for Disease Control, said the number of hepatitis A cases reported varies widely from year to year. In 1991, about 29,000 cases were reported in the United States. She said that more cases go unreported than are reported, partly because children who are infected may have no symptoms and so their disease goes unrecognized.
Although most people recover from hepatitis A infections, the disease can be severe, said Dr. Robert Perrillo, a hepatitis expert at Washington University in St. Louis. The virus ""can cause a lot of misery and some deaths,"" he said.
Most people infected with hepatitis A feel ill for two to four weeks with nausea, malaise and jaundice. Then they recover completely. But Dr. Perrillo said about 1 percent of hepatitis A patients develop a raging infection that can lead to liver failure in days to weeks. Eighty percent of these people die unless they receive a liver transplant. Role of Hygiene
Hepatitis A is spread through fecal-oral contamination. A child in a day-care center may be infected. An adult changes the child's diaper and gets the virus on her hands. She then infects other children. They go home and spread the disease to their families. Or a chef in a restaurant may be infected, neglect to wash his hands before handling food and generate an outbreak of the disease among people who eat food he prepares.
One problem researchers faced in testing a hepatitis A vaccine is that it is hard to predict where outbreaks will occur. But Dr. Werzberger was able to get around that problem by studying the Kiryas Joel community, which is highly unusual because it is plagued by yearly epidemics of hepatitis A.
Almost no one in Kiryas Joel escapes infection, Dr. Werzberger said. Nearly 70 percent of the community members have been infected by the time they are 19 years old. Vaccine Test
Hepatitis A is thought to spread in the Kiryas Joel community primarily through young children, who enter school by age 2 1/2 to 3 and often infect each other, their teachers and their families. Dr. Werzberger said the children themselves often have no symptoms at all, or they ""may vomit once or twice or they may have a little fever."" He added, ""Unless your level of suspicion is very high, you may miss their infection entirely.""",1992-08-13 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,hepatitis A

About 25,000 cases each of hepatitis A and B were reported to the centers last year. Hepatitis is a serious inflammation of the liver, causing fever and aches, which can be fatal in rare cases. Type B is considered a more serious threat because some people develop lifelong infections with the virus, leading to severe liver damage or cancer.
Two explanations have been proposed for the new link between hepatitis A and drug abuse, the centers said. The illness may be spread through use of drugs contaminated with the virus. Or the virus might be spread in direct person-to-person contact, perhaps in needle sharing, sexual contact or poor personal hygiene.

They could receive the vaccine at the same time as their booster against tetanus and diphtheria, because a newly licensed vaccine -- Adacel, made by Sanofi Pasteur -- offers protection against all three diseases.

493,153 Hepatitis Cases Are Traced To Frozen Imported Strawberries,"The virus is often transmitted orally from contamination of food and water through human waste. Symptoms can develop from two to six weeks after exposure to the virus, and usually occur within 30 days. The infection occurs worldwide. About one-third of Americans have been infected with the virus, but many never knew they had it because they may have had no symptoms.
There is no test to detect hepatitis A in food. The only other outbreak of hepatitis A from frozen strawberries was reported in 1990, Dr. Broome said.
Gamma globulin, which is prepared from human blood, can be injected to help prevent illness if given before exposure to the hepatitis A virus or within 14 days afterward. The gamma globulin is pooled from many donors so that antibodies that are naturally produced to protect against infection can be used. The immunity offered by gamma globulin is short-lived. Immunization with the hepatitis A vaccine is needed to provide long-term protection.
Because gamma globulin is in short supply, it is being recommended only for those who were known to ingest strawberries from the 13 lots that were implicated in the Michigan outbreak and also shipped to California, Dr. Broome said. Dr. Friedman said the F.D.A. believed that there was enough gamma globulin available to meet the needs of those affected by the strawberry outbreak. But a complicating factor is in trying to reach the families that are on spring break.
In Los Angeles, health officials plan to offer gamma globulin shots to the 9,000 students and teachers who may have been exposed in schools there. School and health officials determined that strawberries were included in fruit cups that were served from March 25 to 28 in 18 Los Angeles public schools.
Although the strawberries were known to be imported from Mexico, the source of the contamination is not known.
In Mexico, Israel Camacho, Assistant Secretary of Agriculture for Baja California State, where the strawberries were grown, said he did not think irrigation water was the source of the contamination, The Associated Press reported. ''It is more likely that the strawberries were contaminated, if they were contaminated, during processing and packing rather than during cultivation,'' he said.",1997-04-03 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,hepatitis A

495,HEPATITIS OUTBREAK STUDIED IN CAROLINA,"An outbreak of hepatitis with the highest death rate known to Federal epidemiologists is being investigated in North Carolina to learn if a new and virulent strain of hepatitis virus has emerged.
As of yesterday, the viral liver infection had killed six of nine individuals 18 to 26 years old who were hospitalized in New Bern, N.C., since July 12. The last death occurred Aug. 7. The spread of the disease has been linked to the use of illicit drugs by the victims through contamination of needles or syringes.
The 67 percent death rate in the outbreak contrasts sharply to the 1 percent figure that doctors in this country, Europe and Australia have reported for hepatitis B, the type involved in the New Bern area.
For this reason, Federal scientists from the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta also are studying the possibility that a drug or some other unidentified factor potentiated, or substantially increased, the effect of the hepatitis virus, making it more lethal than usual.",1979-08-16 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,hepatitis A

Why the clams were contaminated remains unclear, according to Dr. Yan and an official from the municipal health bureau. However, it is common practice in China for cities and towns to dump raw sewage into rivers and harbors. ''People like shellfish in this city and this province,'' Dr. Yan said. ''They only dip the clams in boiling water for a moment, not really long enough to kill the virus.'' Many Lack Immunity
The disease has spread rapidly, Dr. Yan said, because much of the city's younger population does not have an immunity to the virus.
People who once have hepatitis-A, he explained, cannot get it again. They are not immune to the more serious hepatitis-B, which is caused by a different virus.
''There was an outbreak of hepatitis five years ago,'' Dr. Yan said, ''but it was not very severe and not many people were infected and got immune.''
At his 350-bed hospital, Dr. Yan showed a visitor an obstetrics ward that had been transformed into an isolation area for hepatitis patients.
Patients, bundled in layers of sweaters and jackets against the leaden cold that hung in the unheated building, lay quietly on iron-framed cots in the hall of the ward. Nurses and doctors wrapped in surgical gowns and masks moved among the beds quickly, dispensing a bit of medicine here and there.

497,Covid-19 Vaccine Side Effects: Your Questions Answered,"A lack of side effects does not mean the vaccine isn’t working, said Dr. Paul Offit, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania and a member of the Food and Drug Administration’s vaccine advisory panel. Dr. Offit noted that during the vaccine trials, a significant number of people didn’t report side effects, and yet the trials showed that about 95 percent of people were protected. “That proves you don’t have to have side effects in order to be protected,” he said.
Nobody really knows why some people have a lot of side effects and others have none. We do know that younger people mount stronger immune responses to vaccines than older people, whose immune systems get weaker with age. Women typically have stronger immune responses than men. But again, these differences don’t mean that you aren’t protected if you don’t feel much after getting the shot.
Scientists still aren’t sure how effective the vaccines are in people whose immune systems may be weakened from certain medical conditions, such as cancer treatments or H.I.V. infection or because they are taking immune suppressing drugs. But most experts believe the vaccines still offer these patients some protection against Covid-19.
The bottom line is that even though individual immune responses can vary, the data collected so far show that all three vaccines approved in the United States — Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson — are effective against severe illness and death from Covid-19.
Q: I took Tylenol before I had my Covid vaccine shots and had very little reaction to the shots. Did I make a big mistake?
You shouldn’t try to stave off discomfort by taking a pain reliever before getting the shot. The concern is that premedicating with a pain reliever like acetaminophen (Tylenol) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), which can prevent side effects like arm soreness as well as fever or headache, might also blunt your body’s immune response.
While it’s possible that taking a pain reliever before your shots might have dampened your body’s immune response, vaccine experts say you shouldn’t worry, and you shouldn’t try to get a new round of replacement shots. Studies of other vaccines suggest that while premedicating can dull the body’s immune response to a vaccine, your immune system can still mount a strong enough defense to fight infection. A review of studies of more than 5,000 children compared antibody levels in children who took pain relievers before and after vaccinations and those who did not. They found that pain relievers did not have a meaningful impact on immune response, and that children in both groups generated adequate levels of antibodies after their shots.
The high efficacy of all the Covid vaccines suggests that even if taking Tylenol before the shot did blunt your body’s immune response, there’s some wiggle room, and you are likely still well protected against Covid-19. “You should feel reassured that you’ll have enough of an immune response that you’ll will be protected, especially for vaccines that are this good,” said Dr. Offit.",2021-04-02 15:01:46,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,hepatitis A
498,WARNING ON HEPATITIS B VIRUS,"Babies of mothers with hepatitis B infections may become lifetime carriers of the virus if not vaccinated shortly after birth, researchers reported yesterday.
Infants born to mothers with hepatitis B have an 85 percent chance of being infected themselves, many without ever developing symptoms of the disease, Dr. Cladd Stevens of the New York Blood Center said in a report published yesterday in The Journal of the American Medical Association.
In adults, hepatitis B is a liver disease that can last from a few weeks to a lifetime and range in severity from mild to fatal. Even in asymptomatic infections, such as in young children, it is associated with cirrhosis and liver cancer. About 200,000 new cases of hepatitis B occur each year and about 800,000 Americans are carriers of the virus.
In the past, newborns of mothers with hepatitis B have been given hepatitis B immune globulin, an antibody serum that protects the baby from the disease but does not stimulate a protective response from the infant's immune system. Vaccination augments protection provided by antibody injections, reducing the risk of infection to 14 percent from 25 percent, Dr. Stevens said.",1985-03-23 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,hepatitis B

He was 85 and lived in Philadelphia.
His family said he died, apparently of a heart attack, shortly after giving a keynote speech at a NASA conference at the Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, which is in the San Francisco Bay area. Dr. Blumberg had long been associated with a NASA project to hunt for micro-organisms in space.
Dr. Blumberg’s prize-winning virology and epidemiology work began in the 1960s at the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia and took him and his colleagues on field trips around the world, from Japan to Africa.
The work led to the discovery of the hepatitis B virus in 1967, the first test for hepatitis B in the blood supply and the development in 1969 of the hepatitis B vaccine — the first “cancer vaccine.” Dr. Irving Millman, a colleague at the research center, was its co-creator.",2011-04-06 22:01:41,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,hepatitis B

502,"R. Palmer Beasley, Hepatitis B Researcher, Dies at 76","Dr. R. Palmer Beasley, an epidemiologist who discovered that hepatitis B is easily transferred from mothers to infants during childbirth, confirmed the role of the virus in causing liver cancer and saved millions of lives by helping to persuade world health officials to include a vaccine for the virus in its global recommendations for immunizations, died on Saturday at his home in Houston. He was 76.
The cause was pancreatic cancer, said his wife, Dr. Lu-Yu Hwang.
Dr. Beasley became particularly interested in hepatitis B in the mid-1960s, after it was isolated in the blood serum of an aboriginal Australian by Dr. Baruch S. Blumberg, an American who later helped develop the vaccine and shared the Nobel Prize for his research in infectious diseases.
Hepatitis B and liver cancer were far more common in developing countries than in the United States, and Dr. Blumberg and others struggled to understand why. It was Dr. Beasley and his colleagues who discovered that in developing countries hepatitis B, a blood-borne virus, was commonly passed from mother to infant during childbirth.
At the time, Dr. Beasley was on the faculty of the University of Washington but was working in Taiwan at a special American medical research unit in Taipei. He and his colleagues began what became a decades-long study of 22,000 Taiwanese civil servants, which helped determine that immunizing infants at birth was the best way to prevent them from contracting hepatitis B as well as cirrhosis and liver cancer. Before the vaccine was developed, infants had a much higher rate of contracting a chronic form of the virus, which often showed no symptoms until it developed into cirrhosis or liver cancer decades later.",2012-08-27 03:47:05,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,hepatitis B

Until now, the oldest viral DNA ever recovered from human remains was just 450 years old.
The research may provide clues to the continuing evolution of hepatitis B, a plague that infects an estimated 257 million people worldwide and contributes to an epidemic of liver cancer.

504,Parents Face Questions on Vaccinating Infants for Hepatitis B,"They say there is evidence to suggest that at least some infants who receive the vaccine will remain protected into the teen-age years and that a single booster shot will probably be all that is necessary for those who do not. They add that 8 percent of hepatitis B infections are acquired before the age of 10, and that a child's chances of developing a deadly form of hepatitis B are three times as great as those of adults. Groups at High Risk
More to the point, these officials say that programs aimed at people at risk for hepatitis B -- infants of women with the infection, intravenous drug users, homosexual men, immigrants, health-care workers and people with multiple sexual partners -- have failed to stem the spread of the disease. About a third of people with hepatitis B admit to no risk factors.
They believe that many pediatricians shy away from this particular vaccine because they do not witness the devastation caused by hepatitis B.
""Pediatricians say, 'I don't see this disease, so why should I immunize all my patients against it?' "" said Dr. Caroline Breese Hall, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Rochester and chairman of the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Infectious Disease. ""They don't understand how important this is.""
Children rarely get hepatitis B, and even when they do, it generally does not cause them problems for decades. At all ages, the initial infection with the virus often produces minimal symptoms, and in most people the virus disappears without complications. But 10 percent of people will develop a chronic infection; these carriers, who may not know they are infected, can spread the disease and, over decades, the persistent presence of the virus can lead to liver failure, or in some cases cancer, that often cannot be effectively treated.
Dr. Melvin Marks, medical director of Memorial Miller Children's Hospital in Long Beach, Calif., noted that hepatitis B was more common in the inner-city poor and in certain immigrant communities. ""Middle- and upper-class citizens and their doctors are not in contact with groups that have a problem with the disease, so they don't feel much urgency about this,"" he said, noting that infants born at his hospital receive the shot.
There are about a quarter of a million new hepatitis B infections in the United States each year, and about 5,000 people die from complications annually.

Until that time, the State Department of Health had supported the measure. But then the Senate added an amendment, introduced by State Senator C. Louis Bassano, a Republican from Union, that would have allowed parents to decide whether to inoculate their children for Hepatitis B -- usually transmitted through sexual contact or intravenuous drug use -- and the measure was left off the legislative calendar.

506,HEPATITIS VACCINE PRODUCED BY GENE-SPLICING,"A expensive, conventional vaccine against the hepatitis B virus already exists, but it is made from a virus protein that circulates in the blood of people who have been infected and is harvested from donated human blood plasma. Because of its source, it is difficult to make and is too expensive for worldwide use. It has been avoided by some people because they fear that a vaccine derived from donated blood might expose them to extraneous blood-borne viruses such as those that may cause acquired immune deficiency syndrome, AIDS.
Many promiscuous homosexuals become infected wth the hepatitis B virus. It is among this group also that AIDS is most common, hence the fear that donated blood containing the hepatitis B protein might also contain the virus or viruses that are believed to cause AIDS. However, the vaccine material is rigorously purified and fear of contamination is believed to be unfounded.
Although the vaccine is still in the research stage, Dr. Scolnick estimated that it might become generally available in two or three years. The timing cannot be predicted precisely because it depends on the outcome of future research and on approval by the Food and Drug Administration.
The need for such a vaccine is great. Today there are estimated to be more than 200 million cases of liver disease worldwide that are caused by the virus. At least that many people are carriers of the virus and are capable of passing it on to others. Wide Regions of Infection

507,Man Dying From Hepatitis Is Given a Baboon's Liver,"The Pittsburgh surgeons said before operating that they modified yesterday's operation to take account of what they had learned from the first case and from a series of continuing animal experiments. But the second recipient will rely on the same cocktail of four drugs to keep his body from rejecting the baboon liver.
One anti-rejection drug, FK-506, is experimental and has been tested on more than 2,000 patients, mostly in Pittsburgh. The other three drugs are on the market. One is an anti-cancer drug, cyclophosphamide, that is being used in the transplant recipient to prevent growth of B cells in the immune system. B cell production occurs after a foreign substance, or antigen, stimulates the production of antibodies that attack the antigen. The two other drugs, prostaglandin and prednisone, are aimed at countering inflammation.
Because too much cyclophosphamide may have been responsible for the first recipient's fatal infection, the second patient will receive a smaller amount, Dr. Starzl said. Baboon Blood Cells Used
To prevent a buildup of the harmful bile sludge, the team implanted a thin tube to aid in flushing the ducts in the second recipient's baboon liver.
Dr. Starzl's team also added a new step in yesterday's operation.
Before surgery, white cells were taken from the baboon's blood and bone marrow. Then they were purified. After Dr. Fung's surgical team was sewing the baboon liver in place, doctors slowly injected the baboon blood and bone marrow cells into the man.
Such transfusions have been used in different forms in transplant surgery for 20 years, although doctors do not know why the transfusions seem to improve results.
From human and animal research, Dr. Starzl said he had come to believe that a phenomenon involving cell migration is crucial in promoting long-term acceptance of a donor organ. The phenomenon, chimerism, involves the movement of cells from the baboon liver to elsewhere in the recipient's body, while human cells invade the baboon liver.",1993-01-11 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,hepatitis B

Rates increased especially among Native Americans and Alaska Natives, and non-Hispanic white people.
The risk of sexual transmission of the disease is low, but it increases for people who have multiple partners, who have a sexually transmitted disease or who are infected with H.I.V., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

It is impossible to tell in advance whether an infected individual will go on to suffer serious consequences. For patients who can afford them, the temptation to take the new drugs before trouble arises will be powerful.
A Heavy Toll
An estimated three to four million Americans are infected with hepatitis C, and about 150 million worldwide — three to five times the number who have H.I.V. Most people who are infected do not know it, because it can take decades for the virus to damage the liver sufficiently to cause symptoms.
In the United States, the number of new infections has fallen to about 17,000 a year, from more than 200,000 per year in the 1980s, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There has been a recent rise in cases among young people who inject pain medicines or heroin.
About 16,600 Americans had hepatitis C listed as a cause of death on death certificates in 2010, though that might vastly understate the mortality linked to the disease, according to the C.D.C. Although there are fewer new infections, the number of deaths is expected to keep rising as the infections incurred years ago increasingly take their toll.",2013-11-04 19:49:40,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,hepatitis C
511,Are New Drugs for Hepatitis C Safe? A Report Raises Concerns,"The virus is blood-borne, and the most common source of infection is needle-sharing among people who use illicit drugs. In the United States before 1992, when a test became available to screen donated blood, many cases were caused by transfusions. In countries where the blood supply is not screened, transfusions still pose a risk. Needlestick injuries and other hospital accidents may also cause some cases.
There is no vaccine to prevent the infection, so treatments have long been eagerly sought.
The drugs covered in the new report include two blockbusters, Sovaldi and Harvoni, both made by Gilead Sciences and priced at $1,000 a pill, with billions of dollars in sales. Sovaldi was approved in 2013, and Harvoni in 2014. These drugs and other antivirals can cure the disease in 12 weeks in many patients.
Earlier drugs were less effective, had to be taken for much longer and had harsh side effects that left many patients unable to finish the course of therapy.
About 250,000 people took the newer drugs in 2015, the report said, at tremendous expense: $55,000 to $125,000 per patient. In those treated during the year ending June 30, 2016, the report identified 524 with liver failure, 165 of whom died. Of those with liver failure, 386 were from outside the United States. An additional 1,058 had severe liver injury, and in 761 the drugs appeared not to work.
But whether the drugs were to blame is not known. The problems were observed by doctors who suspected drugs were the cause, but that does not prove cause and effect. And details about the patients’ medical histories were not available.
A spokesman for Gilead, Mark Snyder, wrote in an email, “We closely assess both post-marketing safety reports as well as safety data from our clinical trials on an ongoing basis and have found no suggestion of a causal relationship between Sovaldi or Harvoni and liver failure.”
He added that Gilead’s drugs had been approved for people with severe liver disease from hepatitis C, and that some would inevitably suffer liver failure despite the best treatment.",2017-01-24 20:57:58,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,hepatitis C

As people with private insurance gained access to hepatitis C treatment, it became less defensible to withhold it from prisoners. Florida had treated just 13 inmates when the federal court intervened. More than 5,000 inmates there have been diagnosed with chronic hepatitis C, but the corrections department does not conduct proactive screening, so officials concede there are likely closer to 20,000.
The Florida Legislature has allocated $36 million to fund treatment through June 30, 2019, in a budget bill that awaits the governor’s signature. State Senator Jeff Brandes, chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on Criminal and Civil Justice, believes that amount will be sufficient to satisfy the court’s order to treat the sickest inmates, but it will leave thousands of others infected.
“You kind of feel like Sisyphus pushing the rock up the hill,” he said.
Left untreated, prisoners will suffer irreparable liver damage and may transmit the infection to others. While state prisons that withhold drugs may protect their own budgets, the cost will likely still fall on taxpayers once the prisoners are released and seek care through Medicaid or other avenues, said Dr. Harish Moorjani, an infectious disease specialist who oversees care for prisoners in New York State.
“You may take a short-term view, whether you are a governor or a state legislature or whatever budget authority you are, but there is a price to be paid for that,” Dr. Moorjani said.
New York has taken a longer view, approving 2,009 inmates for treatment between 2014 and 2017 at a cost of about $140 million.
Some states have tried to obtain drugs at lower prices by banding together for greater bargaining power and by enrolling prisoners as patients in hospitals that already get discounted drugs.

As a schoolboy in this Nile Delta rice-farming village, his class marched to the local clinic every month for injections against schistosomiasis, a parasitic disease spread by water snails.
A nurse would boil the syringes, fill each with five doses and then jab five boys in a row with a single needle.
“I didn’t want that hot needle touching me, so I thought I’d be smart,” Mr. Ellabbad, 52, said. “I let the other guys go first.”
Six million Egyptians were infected with hepatitis C by unsterile needles during the country’s decades-long fight against schistosomiasis. The virus spread insidiously; today, at least 10 percent of Egyptians, nearly nine million people, are chronically infected, the highest rate in the world.",2015-12-15 20:51:28,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,hepatitis C
514,Hepatitis C Poses New Threat to Many With AIDS,"Up to 40 percent of Americans with H.I.V. -- 300,000 to 400,000 people -- are believed to be infected with the hepatitis C virus, or H.C.V. Among some groups, primarily H.I.V.-positive current and former intravenous drug users, the co-infection rate is thought to be about 90 percent. According to the National Hemophilia Foundation, the co-infection rate among H.I.V.-positive hemophiliacs is equally high.
''This is emerging as a really huge problem,'' said Alan Franciscus, the publisher of the HCV Advocate newsletter and director of the Hepatitis C Support Project in San Francisco. ''Before protease inhibitors, most people died too quickly from H.I.V.-related causes to even know they were infected with H.C.V., which can take years to become symptomatic.''
The mortality statistics reflect the new reality. As the death rate from AIDS has declined, liver disease from hepatitis C has become in many clinics the No. 1 cause of death among those with H.I.V., said Dr. Douglas Dieterich, the chief of gastroenterology and hepatology at Cabrini Medical Center in New York. In some clinics, up to half of the deaths of H.I.V.-infected patients now are from liver failure and not pneumonia or any other infections associated with AIDS.
The hepatitis C virus is the deadliest of the three major varieties of hepatitis. Before the virus was identified in 1989, it was simply called non-A, non-B hepatitis. Health authorities have recognized with increasing alarm just how widespread the illness is.
Almost four million Americans have been infected, and 8,000 to 10,000 die annually from complications of the disease, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Most of those who become infected remain carriers of the virus and can transmit it to others even if they are asymptomatic. While a majority of chronically infected people eventually exhibit some sign of liver damage, only 10 to 20 percent of them progress to cirrhosis or some other potentially fatal form of liver disease.",2001-05-01 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,hepatitis C
515,U.S. Approves Test to Screen Blood for Hepatitis C,"The Food and Drug Administration today approved a test to screen the nation's blood supply for the major remaining source of hepatitis infections related to blood transfusions.
The agency recommended that all blood banks start using the test, for the form of the infection known as hepatitis C, to screen blood donations as soon as possible, said Faye Peterson, an F.D.A. spokeswoman.
Health agencies already require that blood collectors screen for hepatitis B, which for many years was the primary source of viral infections from transfusions. Since screening tests greatly reduced hepatitis B contamination of the blood supply, infection with the related hepatitis C virus is believed responsible for more than 90 percent of the remaining transfusion-associated hepatitis, said Ms. Peterson.
Plans on Test
The American Association of Blood Banks, the American Red Cross and the Council of Community Blood Centers said they would hold a joint news conference in Washington on Thursday to explain their plans for using the new test and what it will mean to the safety of the nation's blood supply.",1990-05-03 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,hepatitis C

After months of medical evaluation, a doctor finally did a blood test for hepatitis B. When that test came back positive, Mr. Green finally understood why he fell so ill: his liver could not effectively remove the toxins from his body.
Mr. Green began antiviral treatment. After eight months, his viral load was undetectable.
Fifteen years later, he is still doing well. Because Mr. Green’s hepatitis went untreated for so long, he suffers from severe liver damage. He must be careful about what he eats, avoiding dairy products and deep-fried foods, and closely monitors his liver health.

517,Three Newly Discovered Viruses May Cause Unexplained Hepatitis,"If distinct, the newly discovered viruses might be named hepatitis H through J.
Hepatitis can be spread in many ways, including through contaminated food and water, sexual intercourse, contaminated needles and blood transfusions.
The incidence of post-transfusion hepatitis has sharply dropped in this country in the last few years since the introduction of a test to detect the hepatitis C virus. But no specific figures are available, Dr. Harold Margolis, an expert in the epidemiology of hepatitis at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, said in an interview.
Although some experts have been dogmatic in saying that all hepatitis viruses have been discovered, other experts at the meeting said there was ample evidence that more viruses are waiting to be found and that no one knows where the hepatitis alphabet will stop.
Hepatitis viruses can produce acute illness that resolves in a few weeks to months or that goes on to become chronic hepatitis and ultimately cirrhosis in a small percentage of cases.
In the United States, about 3 percent of acute hepatitis cases and about 17 percent of chronic hepatitis cases are not caused by hepatitis A through E, Dr. Margolis said.
In England, a survey of more than a million people in three boroughs in London found that about 15 percent of hepatitis there did not result from the viruses that cause hepatitis A through E. There was ""no obvious reason"" for such cases, suggesting the existence of other hepatitis viruses, Dr. Zuckerman said.
Participants at the meeting raised scores of questions about the new virus findings, such as whether any of the viruses could be transmitted through transfusions of blood and blood products, and thus, whether a test was needed to screen the blood supply. But the Abbott scientists said they had not yet developed the ideal test for the three viruses and had not had enough time to conduct the extensive studies needed to firmly grasp their clinical and public health importance.",1995-04-11 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,hepatitis C

The doctor, an anesthesiologist whom health investigators did not identify, administered pain-deadening drugs by needle at 10 Manhattan outpatient centers, including clinics and doctors’ offices, but not at hospitals. The patients were treated between Dec. 1, 2003, and May 1, 2007.
The three patients found to have hepatitis C were administered anesthesia at three different times, Dr. Marcelle Layton, assistant commissioner of the bureau of communicable diseases, said last night. “The common risk factor is the doctor, not the medical procedure,” she said.
Using medical records from the 10 treatment sites, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene has mailed letters to the doctor’s patients urging them to be tested for the virus, which can have an incubation period of six months or more.

519,"Baffling Hepatitis Virus Is Isolated, Scientists Say","Italian researchers believe they have found the last major piece of the puzzle of blood-borne hepatitis.
For decades, scientists have been mystified by a significant portion of hepatitis cases that were not caused by any of the liver disease's main known viral agents, hepatitis A through E. But now, acting on a hunch that unidentified viruses might be found in the blood of AIDS patients because of their weakened immune systems, Dr. Daniele Primi, an Italian scientist, has obtained what he and other scientists said in interviews was strong evidence for a novel hepatitis virus.
Dr. Primi, who works in Brescia at a research laboratory for Diasorin, a medical biotechnology company, has not submitted a paper for publication in a peer-reviewed scientific journal and has yet to obtain proof from a photograph of the virus through an electron microscope. Details of the research are included in the patent applications Diasorin filed in 1998 for discovery of the virus and development of tests, Dr. Primi said.
Still, other researchers are picking up on the early findings. Using an unusual technique to test nearly 600 stored blood samples, largely from the laboratory of Dr. Harvey Alter at the National Institutes of Health, Dr. Primi's team linked the newly found virus to cases of hepatitis with unexplained viral causes.

521,153 Hepatitis Cases Are Traced To Frozen Imported Strawberries,"The virus is often transmitted orally from contamination of food and water through human waste. Symptoms can develop from two to six weeks after exposure to the virus, and usually occur within 30 days. The infection occurs worldwide. About one-third of Americans have been infected with the virus, but many never knew they had it because they may have had no symptoms.
There is no test to detect hepatitis A in food. The only other outbreak of hepatitis A from frozen strawberries was reported in 1990, Dr. Broome said.
Gamma globulin, which is prepared from human blood, can be injected to help prevent illness if given before exposure to the hepatitis A virus or within 14 days afterward. The gamma globulin is pooled from many donors so that antibodies that are naturally produced to protect against infection can be used. The immunity offered by gamma globulin is short-lived. Immunization with the hepatitis A vaccine is needed to provide long-term protection.
Because gamma globulin is in short supply, it is being recommended only for those who were known to ingest strawberries from the 13 lots that were implicated in the Michigan outbreak and also shipped to California, Dr. Broome said. Dr. Friedman said the F.D.A. believed that there was enough gamma globulin available to meet the needs of those affected by the strawberry outbreak. But a complicating factor is in trying to reach the families that are on spring break.
In Los Angeles, health officials plan to offer gamma globulin shots to the 9,000 students and teachers who may have been exposed in schools there. School and health officials determined that strawberries were included in fruit cups that were served from March 25 to 28 in 18 Los Angeles public schools.
Although the strawberries were known to be imported from Mexico, the source of the contamination is not known.
In Mexico, Israel Camacho, Assistant Secretary of Agriculture for Baja California State, where the strawberries were grown, said he did not think irrigation water was the source of the contamination, The Associated Press reported. ''It is more likely that the strawberries were contaminated, if they were contaminated, during processing and packing rather than during cultivation,'' he said.",1997-04-03 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,hepatitis D

Blumberg, the Nobel Prize-winning biochemist and medical anthropologist who discovered the hepatitis B virus, showed that it could cause liver cancer and then helped develop a powerful vaccine to fight it, saving millions of lives, died Tuesday in Moffett Field, Calif. He was 85 and lived in Philadelphia.
His family said he died, apparently of a heart attack, shortly after giving a keynote speech at a NASA conference at the Ames Research Center in Moffett Field, which is in the San Francisco Bay area. Dr. Blumberg had long been associated with a NASA project to hunt for micro-organisms in space.
Dr. Blumberg’s prize-winning virology and epidemiology work began in the 1960s at the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia and took him and his colleagues on field trips around the world, from Japan to Africa.
The work led to the discovery of the hepatitis B virus in 1967, the first test for hepatitis B in the blood supply and the development in 1969 of the hepatitis B vaccine — the first “cancer vaccine.” Dr. Irving Millman, a colleague at the research center, was its co-creator.",2011-04-06 22:01:41,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,hepatitis D

After his release from prison, he made his way to our hospital’s H.I.V. clinic. He took his medications and showed up for his appointments, but he almost never got lab tests, since decades of drug use had obliterated his veins.
Despite the other medical assaults on his body — diabetes, hypertension, hepatitis C, stubborn leg ulcers — his immune system remained intact. About once a year, he’d allow his methadone doctor to draw blood from a ragged vein in his neck — practically the last vein to his name. His T-cell count stayed high enough to protect him from opportunistic infections. He seemed to be one of the rare, lucky “nonprogressors.”

The drug, called Harvoni from Gilead Sciences, could shorten the duration of treatment and provide the first all-oral regimen for many patients.
The new drug also appears to be a bit less expensive for some patients than Gilead’s existing blockbuster hepatitis C drug, Sovaldi, which has become the poster child for those complaining that the cost of medicines is out of control.
Sovaldi costs $1,000 a pill, or $84,000 for a typical 12-week course of treatment, but it must be used with other drugs. Harvoni is even more expensive at $1,125 a pill, or $94,500 for a 12-week course of treatment. But that is roughly in line with the total cost for Sovaldi and the drugs used with it. Many patients will be able to take Harvoni for only eight weeks, at a cost of about $63,000.",2014-10-10 18:45:28,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,hepatitis D

Symptoms can take up to 50 days to appear, so more cases could still be reported. Thus far, 70 of the infected customers were in Virginia, 10 were in Maryland, five in West Virginia, and one apiece were in New York, North Carolina, Wisconsin and Oregon.
The C.D.C. traced the infection to frozen strawberries imported from Egypt, and said it was not aware of other restaurants that may have received infected strawberries. Tropical Smoothie Cafe said it had switched to another supplier for all its restaurants nationwide, and would use only strawberries sourced from the Americas.
The Food and Drug Administration said in a statement that it would increase surveillance of imported strawberries.
Hepatitis A is a liver disease that ranges in severity from a mild illness that lasts weeks to a severe illness that lasts several months, according to the F.D.A.

527,F.D.A. Approves Pill to Treat Hepatitis C,"AbbVie, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Merck, Johnson & Johnson and others are also developing all-oral regimens for hepatitis C that could reach the market in the next one to three years.
Some analysts expect Sovaldi to become one of the best-selling drugs in the world. Matthew Roden, an analyst at UBS, said in a note on Friday that annual sales could surpass the record of around $13 billion achieved by Lipitor, from Pfizer, in its peak year.
Sales are expected to be strong from the start, because many patients, on the advice of their doctors, have been putting off starting treatment until Sovaldi became available.
One person waiting is Tom Espinosa, a building inspector in Oakland, Calif. He has tried the existing drugs and some experimental ones, without success, so this drug might be his last chance. His liver is already deteriorating badly, but he is hoping the new drug will stop the progression.
Other companies are trying to get at least a little piece of Gilead’s bounty. Merck, Roche and Idenix Pharmaceuticals are separately claiming that Sovaldi infringes on patents they hold. Should any of those companies prevail, it is expected they will receive royalties, not keep the drug off the market.
Until two years ago, the treatment for hepatitis C consisted of 24 to 48 weeks of weekly injections of interferon alfa combined with daily tablets of ribavirin. Neither drug was developed specifically to treat hepatitis C. The combination cured about half of patients, but the side effects, including flulike symptoms, anemia and depression, could be severe.
Sovaldi and newer drugs work by inhibiting enzymes produced by the hepatitis C virus. This is the same approach that was used to make drugs for H.I.V. As in H.I.V., two or more of these drugs for hepatitis C must be used together, to prevent the virus from developing resistance.",2013-12-07 01:41:05,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,hepatitis D

In densely populated areas like Hong Kong, “infections that jump from animals to humans must be taken very seriously,” Dr. Sridhar said. “For these kinds of rare infections, unusual infections, even one case is enough to make public health authorities and researchers very alert about the implications of the disease. One is all it takes.”
Although the patient had received a liver transplant, researchers ruled out infection from his blood and organ donors, which all tested negative for the disease. The researchers instead highlighted rat droppings, piles of uncovered garbage and open passageways found near the patient’s home as major risk factors in rodent-borne diseases.
The researchers said that routine hepatitis E testing would have failed to identify the strain, which is significantly different from the one that typically infects humans. They detected the source of the patient’s infection in this case after finding similarities with infected rats in Vietnam.

529,Hepatitis Outbreak Laid to Water and Sewage Failures,"BAGHDAD, Iraq, Sept. 24 - A virulent form of hepatitis that is especially lethal for pregnant women has broken out in two of Iraq's most troubled districts, Iraqi Health Ministry officials said in interviews here this week, and they warned that a collapse of water and sewage systems in the continuing violence in the country is probably at the root of the outbreak. The disease, called hepatitis E, is caused by a virus that is often spread by sewage-contaminated drinking water. The officials said they had equipment to test only a limited number of people showing symptoms, suggesting that only a fraction of the actual cases have been firmly diagnosed. In Sadr City, a Baghdad slum that for months has been convulsed by gun battles between a local militia and American troops, the officials said as many as 155 cases had turned up.
The second outbreak is in Mahmudiya, a town 35 miles south of Baghdad that is known for its kidnappings and shootings as well as for its poverty, where there are an estimated 60 cases. At least nine pregnant women are believed to have been infected, and one has died. Five deaths have been reported over all.
""We are saying that the real number is greatly more than this, because the area is greatly underreported,"" said Dr. Atta-alla Mekhlif Al-Salmani, leader of the viral hepatitis section at Health Ministry's Center of Disease Control.

SmithKline Beecham, of Philadelphia, is a worldwide leader in vaccines. Yet, earlier this month, SmithKline joined Genelabs in the development of a new vaccine for the prevention of hepatitis E.
After creating a diagnostic product, ""you immediately have a vaccine opportunity,"" said Frank F. C. Kung, Genelabs's chairman, president and chief executive. ""But the simple fact of identifying a viral sequence does not automatically lead to development of a vaccine."" Mr. Kung founded Genelabs in 1984 after holding several positions in research planning and business development with the Cetus Corporation.
Genelabs researchers, working with scientists at the Centers for Disease Control, first identified hepatitis E in 1988. It is one of five viruses known to cause liver inflammation, and can be fatal. Mr. Kung said that some of the same proprietary technology that allowed Genelabs to find the disease have enabled the company, again in collaboration with C.D.C., to create a prototype vaccine, which is now being tested in animals.
These technologies include Sequence Independent Single Primary Amplification, or Sispa, which allows the identification and rapid multiplication of unknown genetic sequences, and hepatocyte culturing, which permits the growth of liver cells outside the body. Hepatocyte culture also allows the company to grow hepatitis viruses in the laboratory, which is essential for testing vaccines in vitro before beginning animal trials.",1992-09-13 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,hepatitis E

Cirrhosis causes increasing damage and a variety of problems including accumulation of fluid in the abdomen, yellowing of the skin from jaundice, brain damage and enlargement of veins in the esophagus that burst to cause fatal bleeding.
Cirrhosis is the ninth leading cause of death among adults in the United States. For unknown reasons, death rates from cirrhosis in the United States have declined since 1973 despite the lack of a similar drop in deaths from alcoholism or in per capita consumption of alcohol.
''Here we have something very promising but that is not a medical cure for cirrhosis,'' Dr. Rojkind said in an interview from his office at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in the Bronx, where he now works.
''How significant it is only time will tell, but at least it will change physicians' attitude toward treating cirrhosis,'' Dr. Rojkind said. A Common Symptom
Members of Dr. Rojkind's team wrote that they did not know why colchicine works against cirrhosis. Dr. Rojkind said that in 1972 he began testing colchicine because it was known to suppress the inflammation of gout, and inflammation is a feature of cirrhosis. After studying the drug's effects in rats that were made cirrhotic by feeding them carbon tetrachloride, Dr. Rojkind began testing it in humans. Over the years, he has given progress reports in medical journals.
The latest study involved 54 patients who received colchicine and 46 who received a dummy pill, or placebo. The choice was made randomly without the knowledge of the doctors who treated the patients.

538,ALCOHOL BUT ONE CAUSE OF LIVER CIRRHOSIS,"To the Editor:
''Health Experts Start Campaign on Hepatitis'' (Dec. 16), on a national drive to promote inoculation against a form of infectious viral hepatitis, demonstrates again the degree to which public awareness lags behind medical capabilities, even in an era of widespread concern about health.
It also demonstrates, however, that scientists can similarly be short- sighted, as when they continue to point to alcoholic beverages as crucial in the occurrence of liver cirrhosis.
It is obvious that there are many other causes of cirrhosis, such as Hepatitis B, shellfish infected by sewage in the tri-state area (news article, Nov. 6) and a previously unknown form of hepatitis (non-A, non-B), transmitted through blood transfusion (news article, Nov. 18).
With these newly recognized and rapidly proliferating causes of cirrhosis, quite apart from toxic waste and other unidentified forms of pollution, we may be giving alcohol a bum rap by still considering it the predominant cause of fatal liver disease.

539,HEALTH: LIVER DISEASE; Scientists Seek Ways To Limit Lasting Harm Of Hepatitis Infection,"In an interview, Dr. Blumberg said the tropical weeds, of the genus phyllanthus, came to his attention because of their use as a folk remedy in treating jaundice, a yellowing of the skin that accompanies illness in which the liver is involved. Study of the plants indicated that they contain a chemical, still not completely identified, that interferes with the viruses' nucleic acid and apparently hampers viral reproduction.
In a study reported last year, Dr. Blumberg and colleagues showed that extracts from the plants reduced the amount of hepatitis virus in woodchucks who had chronic infections with a virus closely related to the hepatitis B virus of humans. He said a similar material is being tried in patients in India. Wide Trial Beginning
Just getting under way in this country is a program to test combinations of antiviral drugs involving hepatitis B patients in about a dozen medical centers, including New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center and Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in New York City. A participant in the research, Dr. Jules L. Dienstag of Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, said recruiting of patients for the study is just being completed.
Although the treatment schedule is complicated, it involves initial treatment with prednisone, an anti-inflammatory drug, followed by treatment with interferon, a natural anti-virus substance. The prednisone actually causes a spurt in virus replication, he said. After the drug is removed, virus reproduction drops sharply. The strategy is to follow this with drug attacks against the virus. The scientists hope the anti-virus drug attack then will bolster the patient's immune defenses.
Recently, scientists of Chiron Corporation, a biotechnology company based in Emeryville, Calif., announced discovery of a virus they believe to be the long-sought main cause of non-A, non-B hepatitis infection. While other reports of such discoveries have proved disappointing, this one seems promising, said Dr. Harvey J. Alter, chief of immunology and associate director for research of the department of transfusion medicine of the National Institutes of Health.
Of the major viruses that attack the liver, the hepatitis A virus is the most contagious but usually produces the mildest illnesses. The disease is often like a mild case of the flu, but sometimes it can be severe. The virus spreads through direct or indirect contact with an infected person, often through sewage-contaminated water or food such as shellfish. It is thought to be only rarely involved in infection transmitted by blood transfusion. Virus Overtakes Virus
For many years, there was more hepatitis A than B in the United States. But five years ago, reports to the Centers for Disease Control on infections with the hepatitis B virus surpassed reports of hepatitis A. Vaccines are available to protect against hepatitis B, so the disease is potentially preventable. Experimental vaccines against hepatitis A are in various stages of research.",1988-05-19 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,liver disease
540,"I Have Liver Disease, but It Doesn’t Have Me","My liver had failed. White coats danced like ghosts in front of my jaundiced eyes: doctors and nurses scrambled to dilute my toxic blood. I was sick. And I still am.
But the only thing worse than being sick is having everyone know you are sick. The only thing worse than almost dying is having everyone know you almost died. My tug of war with mortality did not make me some sort of expert on the fragility of life. I don’t have any shrewd insight to offer; no profound advice. What my liver disease has taught me is straightforward and practical: being sick does not mean surrendering to all the connotations and denotations that come with being a “sick person.”
At the hospital, when my parents would tell me  late at night  “We’re going to stay over,” I would refuse. When friends and teachers and co-workers would ask how I was feeling, I would tell them I was fine. When my girlfriend, Kate, would kiss me on the forehead and ask if I had enough energy to watch a movie, the answer was always “yes.”
I’m not naïve. I know that my liver will never be completely healthy. I know that I will always wake up to a sea of clownfish-colored prescription bottles. And I know that I will always wear a medical tag that reads “OWEN BRITTON JENNINGS / TYPE II AUTOIMMUNE LIVER DISEASE.” But that doesn’t mean I’m an invalid. What scares me most  more than the actual, physical symptoms of my disease  is the prospect of letting it infiltrate my identity. Blood transfusions don’t alarm me anymore. I no longer shrink from the mammoth doses of steroids, or the pencil-size needles that the doctors use to biopsy my liver. What frightens me  what downright petrifies me  is the notion that my liver disease might yet win out.",2009-04-20 20:38:37,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,liver disease
541,Possible New Treatment Found for Serious Liver Disease,"But some biologists believe short telomeres may be a drawback in diseases where a cell type is forced to divide unusually often. When Dr. DePinho heard of the Japanese finding of short telomeres in cirrhosis, he decided to test the idea in mice by seeing if insertion of the telomerase gene into liver cells could prevent the development of cirrhosis.
Mice have very long telomeres, so to obtain animals with telomeres as short as those of elderly people, he took a strain that lacked the telomerase gene altogether and bred the mice through several generations.
Cirrhosis was induced in the short-telomere mice by injecting them with a liver-poisoning chemical. In addition, one group of mice was injected with a virus carrying a copy of the mouse telomerase gene. In these mice, development of cirrhosis was blocked, presumably because the telomerase rescued certain short-telomere cells from crisis, enabling them to regenerate the liver.
Because of this finding, Dr. DePinho and colleagues conclude, ''It is reasonable to anticipate that activation of telomerase could inhibit the development of liver cirrhosis or terminal liver failure in humans.''
If the telomere-shortening system protects against cancer, an artificial lengthening of the telomeres might raise a cancer risk. In their article, the authors suggest the telomerase treatment could be tested in patients awaiting a liver transplant, since the liver was due for removal anyway.
Dr. Calvin Harley, scientific director of Geron, the company developing telomerase-based therapies, said Dr. DePinho's work was ''a pretty important first step in establishing that telomere loss can be the trigger of chronic disease.'' Geron has also been working on telomere-based treatments for cirrhosis, but any clinical tests of a treatment are ''certainly not less than two years away,'' Dr. Harley said.
Dr. Arias, the Tufts liver expert, interpreted Dr. DePinho's work more cautiously, saying it was too early even to be sure that short telomeres were the trigger for cirrhosis. Because many questions remain about the timing of telomere shortening and the types of cirrhosis in which shortening occurs, ''It is not a good idea to speculate about the therapeutic aspects or suggest that a clinical trial can be done instantly,'' Dr. Arias said.",2000-02-18 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,liver disease
542,"To Fight Fatty Liver, Avoid Sugary Foods and Drinks","Ultimately, the low-sugar diet was not terribly restrictive. It was not low-carb, nor was it limited in calories. The children could eat fruit, starches and pasta, for example, and they were allowed to eat as much as they wanted. But the goal was to get their added sugar intake to less than 3 percent of their daily calories — less than the 5 to 10 percent limit for adults and children recommended by the World Health Organization.
After eight weeks, the low-sugar group had gotten their added sugar intake down to just 1 percent of their daily calories, compared to 9 percent in the control group. They also had a remarkable change in their liver health. They had a 31 percent reduction in liver fat, on average, compared to no change in the control group. They also had a 40 percent drop in their levels of alanine aminotransferase, or ALT, a liver enzyme that rises when liver cells are damaged or inflamed.
“As a practicing hepatologist, I see children weekly with fatty liver, and I would love to see this kind of improvement in my patients,” said Dr. Vos. “The exciting part was not only did the fat go down, but their liver enzymes also improved. That suggests that they also got a reduction in inflammation.”
The new study was funded in part by the Nutrition Science Initiative, a nonprofit research group that was co-founded by the science and health journalist Gary Taubes, a proponent of low-carb diets. The National Institutes of Health, the University of California, San Diego, Children’s Healthcare of Atlanta and Emory University also provided funding.
Dr. Joel E. Lavine, an expert who was not involved in the study, said it was cleverly done and demonstrated “some important points about what a major constituent of diet contributes to this problem in terms of liver fat and inflammation and cell injury.” He said the ubiquity of unhealthy foods makes such a diet difficult to follow, but that as a general rule doctors should advise patients and their families to check food labels for added sugars and to avoid or eliminate juices.
“The best diet, to make it very simple, is to shop the outside aisles in supermarkets and stay away from the middle aisles containing processed foods that come in boxes, cans and packages,” said Dr. Lavine, the chief of gastroenterology, hepatology and nutrition at Columbia University Irving Medical Center and the Morgan Stanley Children’s Hospital of NewYork-Presbyterian.
The members of the low-sugar group lost about three pounds during the study, which may have contributed to their improvements in liver health. But Dr. Jeffrey B. Schwimmer, an author of the study, said it was unlikely to account for the large changes.",2019-01-22 16:00:01,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,liver disease
543,HEALTH; Alcoholics With Liver Disease Helped by Drug,"''In the long term, it looks like PTU is beneficial to patients, even though they continue to drink,'' said Dr. Jerome Zeldis of Beth Israel Hospital here. But he added, ''I don't think this is ready to become part of the standard therapy for alcoholic liver disease until another group with a large number of patients verifies their findings.''
Dr. Thomas LaMont of the Boston University School of Medicine noted that the drug did not help people who drank heavily.
''The current management of anyone with any complications of alcoholism is to stop drinking completely forever,'' said Dr. LaMont. ''The public has to hear that, because this could be used as a crutch to continue drinking.'' #310 Alcoholics Studied The study, directed by Dr. Hector Orrego, was published in the issue of The New England Journal of Medicine being published Thursday.
The researchers studied 310 alcoholics who had cirrhosis and other liver disease caused by drinking. When they entered the program, the patients were drinking the equivalent of at least eight ounces of whisky a day or went on frequent binges. During the two-year study, half took PTU pills twice a day, while the rest got placebos.
Nearly all the men and women continued to drink. When the study was over, 13 percent of the PTU patients had died, compared with 25 percent of the comparison group. Those who drank less did better, and death rates differed only slightly among those who continued to drink heavily.

544,A Liver Attack Leads to a Simpler Life,"I first met my liver the night it tried to kill me.
I was at home in Hawaii, alone, relaxing after a dinner of leftovers from a party I hosted the night before: macaroni and cheese with manchego and chorizo, tossed greens, a glass of Rioja and a dark-chocolate truffle to finish. It was my favorite meal, and this was the last time I would eat it.
The attack started innocently, in the form of body aches. It progressed rapidly to nausea, vomiting and dizziness. Pain knifed through my gut. I pulled up my T-shirt and found a lump swelling below my ribs. The bigger it swelled, the harder it was to breathe. I panicked and called my husband, Adam, an M.I.T. professor who lived in Boston at the time. We had commuted all six years of our relationship. Hearing his voice calmed me down enough to act.
A friend drove me to the E.R., where I promptly blacked out. I woke up later in a hospital bed, my swollen body plugged with tubes. Doctors informed me that my levels of the enzymes AST and ALT were sky high, signs that my liver was severely damaged and heading toward failure. The cause eluded tests. It took days to convince them that I wasn’t an alcoholic.
Until that night my liver had done its work uncomplainingly and unnoticed, securely out of mind. But pain trumps denial.",2010-10-18 20:24:55,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,liver disease

Yesterday, the Kentucky Occupational Safety and Health Standards Board added vinyl chloride to its list of occupational cancer‐causing agents and greatly reduced the levels of the chemical to which workers can legally be exposed.

546,The Liver: A ‘Blob’ That Runs the Body,"To the Mesopotamians, the liver was the body’s premier organ, the seat of the human soul and emotions. The ancient Greeks linked the liver to pleasure: The words hepatic and hedonic are thought to share the same root.
The Elizabethans referred to their monarch not as the head of state but as its liver, and woe to any people saddled with a lily-livered leader, whose bloodless cowardice would surely prove their undoing.
Yet even the most ardent liverati of history may have underestimated the scope and complexity of the organ. Its powers are so profound that the old toss-away line, “What am I, chopped liver?” can be seen as a kind of humblebrag.
After all, a healthy liver is the one organ in the adult body that, if chopped down to a fraction of its initial size, will rapidly regenerate and perform as if brand-new. Which is a lucky thing, for the liver’s to-do list is second only to that of the brain and numbers well over 300 items, including systematically reworking the food we eat into usable building blocks for our cells; neutralizing the many potentially harmful substances that we incidentally or deliberately ingest; generating a vast pharmacopoeia of hormones, enzymes, clotting factors and immune molecules; controlling blood chemistry; and really, we’re just getting started.",2017-06-12 15:40:57,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,liver disease

Of 69 physical diseases they were able to track, people with depression had a higher risk for 66 of them, even after controlling for other psychiatric illnesses.

548,"Outsider Whose Dark, Lyrical Vision Helped Shape Rock ’n’ Roll","The Velvet Underground, which was originally sponsored by Andy Warhol and showcased the songwriting of John Cale as well as Mr. Reed, wrought gradual but profound impact on the high-I.Q., low-virtuosity stratum of punk, alternative and underground rock around the world. Joy Division, Talking Heads, Patti Smith, R.E.M., the Strokes and numerous others were descendants. The composer Brian Eno, in an often-quoted interview from 1982, suggested that if the group’s first album, “The Velvet Underground & Nico,” sold only 30,000 copies during its first five years — a figure probably lower than the reality — “everyone who bought one of those 30,000 copies started a band.”
Many of the group’s themes — among them love, sexual deviance, alienation, addiction, joy and spiritual transfiguration — stayed in Mr. Reed’s work through his long run of solo recordings. Among the most noteworthy of those records were “Transformer” (1972), “Berlin” (1973) and “New York” (1989). The most notorious, without question, was “Metal Machine Music” (1975).
Beloved of Mr. Reed and not too many others, “Metal Machine Music” was four sides of electric-guitar feedback strobing between two amplifiers, with Mr. Reed altering the speed of the tape recorder; no singing, no drums, no stated key. At the time it was mostly understood, if at all, as a riddle about artistic intent. Was it his truest self? Was it a joke? Or was there no difference?
Mr. Reed wrote in the liner notes that “no one I know has listened to it all the way through, including myself,” but he also defended it as the next step after La Monte Young’s early minimalism. “There’s infinite ways of listening to it,” he told the critic Lester Bangs in 1976.
Not too long after his first recordings, made at 16 with a doo-wop band in Freeport, N.Y., Mr. Reed started singing outside of the song’s melody, as if he were giving a speech with a fluctuating drone in a New York accent. That sound, heard with the Velvet Underground on songs like “Heroin” and “Sweet Jane” and in his post-Velvet songs “Walk on the Wild Side,” “Street Hassle” and others, became one of the most familiar frequencies in rock. He played lead guitar the same way, straining against his limitations.",2013-10-27 19:04:32,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,liver disease

The finding, published Monday in the journal PLOS One, is the most clear-cut instance of an organic food’s offering a nutritional advantage over its conventional counterpart. Studies looking at organic fruits and vegetables have been less conclusive.
Drinking whole organic milk “will certainly lessen the risk factor for cardiovascular disease,” said the study’s lead author, Charles M. Benbrook, a research professor at Washington State University’s Center for Sustaining Agriculture and Natural Resources.
“All milk is healthy and good for people,” he continued, “but organic milk is better, because it has a more favorable balance of these fatty acids” — omega-3, typically found in fish and flaxseed, versus omega-6, which is abundant in many fried foods like potato chips.",2013-12-09 22:13:44,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,fatty
551,Experts Disagree on Adding Fatty Acid to Infant Formula,"Last week, a group of experts convened under the auspices of the Harvard School of Public Health and Ross Laboratories, a formula producer, discussed the reasons for not rushing headlong into supplementing infant formulas with DHA and AA, even though it might seem logical and, on the surface at least, vital to optimal infant development.
''We should assure that formulas are as good as possible, but we must never make formulas less safe,'' said Dr. Stanley Zlotkin, pediatric nutrition specialist at the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto.
''Current formulas are very good and very safe and babies consuming them develop well,'' Dr. Zlotkin said. ''From a nutritional point of view, it is very hard to tell the difference between babies who are breast-fed and those who are bottle-fed.''
Dr. Alan Lucas, an expert in child nutrition at the British Medical Research Council in London who directed the I.Q. study of breast-fed and bottle-fed babies, said there were a great many differences between breast milk and infant formula beyond their fatty acid content. ''If all the factors in breast milk were important,'' he said, ''we should be seeing an epidemic of illnesses among bottle-fed babies. We shouldn't regard breast milk as the perfect guide for making formula.''
It is also not yet clear what, if any, differences between breast milk and formula might influence intelligence. Dr. Robert B. McCall, a psychologist and child development specialist at the University of Pittsburgh, said: ''While breast-fed babies are smarter, the question is why. Other factors in milk than DHA could also account for the higher intelligence of breast-fed babies.''
Furthermore, he said, mothers who choose to breast-feed are likely to be different in some important ways from mothers who choose to feed their babies formula. These days, nursing mothers tend to be better educated and economically more secure. Even though studies account for factors like the mother's education and socioeconomic level and the status of the baby at birth, there is no way to control for the effects of the postnatal environment, which can strongly influence a child's performance on I.Q. tests and in school.
The only way to be certain that the kind of nutrition given is responsible for the developmental differences observed is to assign babies randomly to receive either regular formula or formula supplemented with DHA and AA, Dr. McCall said. Such studies are now under way both in preterm and full-term babies, who must be followed for several years to determine first if there is a developmental advantage to the supplemented formula and second if that difference persists beyond the first few years of life.",1996-11-06 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,fatty
552,How Exercise Can Make for Healthier Fat,"Exercise could help to make your fat tissue healthier, which, hear me out, is a good thing.
According to a timely new study, a single session of exercise may change the molecular workings of fat tissue in ways that, over time, should improve metabolic health.
This finding has particular relevance during the holidays, when, despite our best intentions, so many of us add to our fat stores. Exercise might make these annual bacchanals less metabolically damaging than otherwise.
Most of us probably think of our fat tissue as inert and undesirable. But our fat is, in fact, a busy and necessary tissue, producing and sending out multiple biochemical signals that affect biological operations throughout the body.
Fat tissue’s most important responsibility, however, is to securely store fat, and we should hope that it performs this function well. Provocative recent research in both animals and people has found that, if a person’s or animal’s fat tissue is relatively leaky, allowing fatty acids to ooze into the bloodstream, those roving fat blobs can accumulate in other tissues, particularly the muscles and liver. Once there, they contribute to the development of insulin resistance, a serious metabolic condition that often leads to diabetes.",2017-12-06 11:00:01,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,fatty
553,FILM FESTIVAL REVIEW; Of Taiwan's Bourgeoisie and Its Affecting Charms,"Midway through ''Yi Yi,'' a morose, skeletally thin teenager (whose nickname is Fatty) tells his date: ''Movies are lifelike. That's why we like them.'' In his view, movies don't only resemble the world we live in -- they expand it. ''We live three times,'' he declares, his passion overwhelming his arithmetic. ''Two times as much life at the movies!'' After watching this lovely, absorbing film you'll be inclined to agree. In exchange for three hours of your time, ''Yi Yi'' will give you more life.
Edward Yang, the Taiwanese filmmaker who wrote and directed this intimate epic of a middle-class Taipei's family's everyday struggles, knows that for a movie to be full of life, it must above all concern itself with specific lives. ''Yi Yi'' begins with the chaotic bustle of wedding preparations -- a portrait of the bride and groom is hung upside down, the groom's jilted girlfriend arrives uninvited and makes a scene -- and ends with the somber calm of a funeral.
In the long interval between these events, the members of the Jian family collectively and individually traverse what feels like the full spectrum of human experience, from the mundane to the catastrophic. NJ (Wu Nienjen), the wiry, sad-eyed patriarch, must deal with setbacks at his software company and a midlife crisis triggered by the reappearance of Sherry (Ke Suyun), his high-school sweetheart. NJ's wife, Min-Min (Elaine Jin), despondent over her mother's crippling stroke, retreats first into depression and then into a religious cult. Their teenage daughter, Ting-Ting (Kelly Lee), undergoes her own identity crisis, caught between loyalty to her troubled best friend and the slightly dangerous appeal of Fatty (Yupang Chang). There is a birth, a suicide attempt and a murder. Friendships are made and broken. Ting-Ting's runty younger brother, Yang-Yang (Jonathan Chang), is harassed at school by a gang of bigger girls. There is a lot of music (NJ's passion), eating and drinking, all of it set amid the sleek cosmopolitan kineticism of Taipei and, briefly, Tokyo, where NJ goes in search of an investor to save his business and a second chance with Sherry, who is now married to an American businessman.
But ''Yi Yi'' is more than a soap opera, which is to say it's less. The mood is restrained and gentle and the narrative rhythm fluid and easy, meandering from story to story. Although it rises on occasion to a high pitch of intensity, this movie never feels overwrought or melodramatic. The title is nothing more than the Chinese word for ''one'' repeated twice; the Chinese characters, which appear in the opening titles, look like birds in flight seen from afar. The English translation, ''A One and a Two,'' suggests a bandleader counting off, and ''Yi Yi,'' composed with the meticulous discipline of a symphony, nonetheless has the swing and spontaneity of group improvisation.",2000-10-04 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,fatty
554,"Fat, Glorious Fat, Moves to the Center of the Plate","Trestle and Momofuku would be high on the health commissioner’s list, but probably no higher than the new restaurant Resto, where some genius — and I am most certainly not being facetious — decided that deviled eggs aren’t sufficiently rich on their own. No, they need amplification, and of course they need meat, so they’re placed on rectangles of pork jowl. One more thing: these rectangles are deep-fried. At a certain point, I suppose, there’s no turning back.
It’s as if decades of proliferating sushi and shrinking plates, of clean California cuisine and exhortations to graze, have fostered a robust (or is that rotund?) counterculture of chefs and diners eager to cut against the nutritional grain and straight into the bellies of beasts. In fact, bellies (most often pork, more recently lamb) are this counterculture’s LSD.
Its Timothy Leary might well be David Chang, the chef at Momofuku, where steamed buns are filled with strips of pork belly. Or maybe it’s Zak Pelaccio, the chef at the tellingly named restaurant Fatty Crab. One of its best-selling dishes, called the fatty duck, takes strips of a bird not exactly known for its leanness, dusts them with cornstarch and deep-fries them.
The “crispy pork” with pickled watermelon in a dish that Fatty Crab mockingly labels a salad amounts to cubes of fried pork belly, and the rest of the menu (pork ribs, small burgers doused with mayonnaise and aptly named fatty sliders) works a similarly clogged vein. During a recent lunch there with a dauntless friend, I was touched by the way our server — let’s call him Sisyphus — replenished the moist towelettes at our table over and over again. What we really needed him to do was put a dropcloth under us and, at meal’s end, hose us down.
Mr. Pelaccio’s appreciation of a fatty rib extends from pork to lamb, and at the restaurant 5 Ninth, from which he recently severed his ties, he occasionally served lamb ribs, the far reaches of which incorporated bits of lamb belly, he said.

556,Researchers Are Hatching a Low-Cost Covid-19 Vaccine,"The resulting spike — called 2P, for the two new proline molecules it contained — was far more likely to assume the desired tulip shape. The researchers injected the 2P spikes into mice and found that the animals could easily fight off infections of the MERS coronavirus.
The team filed a patent for its modified spike, but the world took little notice of the invention. MERS, although deadly, is not very contagious and proved to be a relatively minor threat; fewer than 1,000 people have died of MERS since it first emerged in humans.
But in late 2019 a new coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, emerged and began ravaging the world. Dr. McLellan and his colleagues swung into action, designing a 2P spike unique to SARS-CoV-2. In a matter of days, Moderna used that information to design a vaccine for Covid-19; it contained a genetic molecule called RNA with the instructions for making the 2P spike.
Other companies soon followed suit, adopting 2P spikes for their own vaccine designs and starting clinical trials. All three of the vaccines that have been authorized so far in the United States — from Johnson & Johnson, Moderna and Pfizer-BioNTech — use the 2P spike.
Other vaccine makers are using it as well. Novavax has had strong results with the 2P spike in clinical trials and is expected to apply to the Food and Drug Administration for emergency use authorization in the next few weeks. Sanofi is also testing a 2P spike vaccine and expects to finish clinical trials later this year.
Two prolines are good; six are better
Dr. McLellan’s ability to find lifesaving clues in the structure of proteins has earned him deep admiration in the vaccine world. “This guy is a genius,” said Harry Kleanthous, a senior program officer at the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. “He should be proud of this huge thing he’s done for humanity.”
But once Dr. McLellan and his colleagues handed off the 2P spike to vaccine makers, he turned back to the protein for a closer look. If swapping just two prolines improved a vaccine, surely additional tweaks could improve it even more.",2021-04-05 09:00:24,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,fatty
557,Study Finds That Fat Cells Die and Are Replaced,"In a way, Dr. Flier noted, the discovery is a sort of back-to-the-future moment. There was a time a few decades ago, before the current interest in how the brain regulates how much is eaten, when obesity researchers spent all their time studying and discussing fat cells. Investigators discovered that fat people had more fat cells than thin people and that fat cells shrank with weight loss and bulged with weight gain.
Dr. Jules Hirsch of Rockefeller University in New York, who did many of the initial studies with humans, said he started because he could not understand why people who lost weight regained. “They should have been cured,” Dr. Hirsch said. After all, he said, if you cut out a fatty tumor, the fat does not grow back. Why was fat lost from dieting different?
The result was the fat cell hypothesis, a notion that obsessed researchers. Fat cells, the hypothesis said, are laid down early in life and after that, they can change only in size, not in number. When people lose weight and their fat cells shrink, that creates a signal to fill the cells again, making people regain. “We didn’t know a lot about obesity, so that was what we talked about,” Dr. Flier said.
But the discussions stalled. It was not clear what to do about those discoveries or what they meant to efforts to help people lose weight. And no one had a method to ask whether fat cells were being created and destroyed during life. Few even thought to ask that question.
That changed only recently when the new paper’s first author, Kirsty L. Spalding, a neurobiologist at the Karolinska Institute in Sweden, developed a way to ask whether new cells grow in the cortical and cerebellum regions of the human brain. She found no new cells there since birth. One day, she was giving a talk on her brain study when a scientist in the audience, Erik Arner, suggested she use the method to look at fat cells. (Dr. Arner is the second author of Dr. Spalding’s paper.) The method for dating human cells takes advantage of an effect caused by above-ground nuclear bomb testing that took place from 1955 to 1963.
When the bombs were tested, their radioactivity created a spike in the amount of a carbon isotope, C14, in the atmosphere. The C14 made its way into plants and animals that ate the plants. When people ate those plants and meat from the animals, the C14 was incorporated into their human DNA. After the nuclear test ban, C14 levels started to drop. The result is that every cell has a C14 level that reflects the level in the atmosphere at the time the cell was born.
“Each cell is a time capsule of sorts,” Dr. Spalding said.
First the researchers confirmed that the number of fat cells remained constant in adults. Obese people who had weight loss surgery had as many fat cells two years after the surgery as before it, even though they were much thinner.",2008-05-05 04:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,fatty
558,Does Coconut Oil Deserve Its Health Halo?,"Dr. Greenland echoed that assessment, stating that “the marketing of coconut oil is confusing. It’s trying to sell it as a healthy fat, but those who know its composition don’t think that at all.”
These and other experts part company with advertisers and advocates for coconut oil based on its chemical makeup and the well-established biological activity of different kinds of fatty acids.
“Fat can’t circulate by itself,” Dr. Greenland said, explaining that long-chain fatty acids like those prominent in beef tallow are absorbed into the bloodstream by fat-carrying particles called chylomicrons that deliver the fat to tissues throughout the body. Chylomicrons keep LDL cholesterol in circulation, giving it ample opportunity to get stuck in arteries. Fats that are mainly medium-chain fatty acids, on the other hand, are more water-soluble; they can be absorbed into the bloodstream without the assistance of chylomicrons and transported directly to the liver, where they are used for energy.
Although lauric acid is usually referred to as a medium-chain fatty acid, Dr. Sacks said, this label is really arbitrary. “Classifying lauric acid as a medium-chain fatty acid is a misnomer,” he wrote. “Rather than the number of carbon atoms in a fat,” he said, “what counts is how the fat is metabolized in the body. Lauric acid behaves like a long-chain fatty acid,” the kind that promotes atherosclerosis. In addition, coconut oil has two other long-chain fatty acids — myristic and palmitic — and all three have an artery-damaging effect on cholesterol levels in the blood.
One claim made for coconut oil is undisputed: It can raise blood levels of HDL cholesterol, which has long been thought to protect against heart disease. However, a clear-cut health benefit of HDL cholesterol has yet to be demonstrated in people. As Dr. Sacks reported, “Genetic studies and HDL-raising drugs have not so far supported a causal relationship between HDL cholesterol and cardiovascular disease. HDL is composed of a huge array of subparticles that may have adverse or beneficial actions. It is unknown which, if any, foods or nutrients that raise HDL cholesterol do so in a way that reduces atherosclerosis and coronary events.”
Ditto, said Dr. Greenland. “Efforts to raise HDL have not led to beneficial clinical improvements.”
Proponents are also fond of citing the fact that a number of Indigenous populations — including Polynesians, Melanesians, Sri Lankans and Indians — consume rather large amounts of coconut products without suffering high rates of cardiovascular disease. However, most of these people have traditionally eaten coconut flesh or squeezed coconut cream as part of a diet that is low in processed foods and rich in fruits and vegetables, with fish as the main source of protein. They are also far more active physically than typical Westerners.
But even that is now changing, a New Zealand research team reported, with the “imports of unhealthy foods such as corned beef, fast food and processed ingredients, leading to huge increases in obesity and poor health.”",2021-01-04 10:00:08,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,fatty

560,Think Like a Doctor: The Builder’s Blisters Solved!,"On Thursday we asked Well readers to take on the difficult case of a 64-year-old contractor who had had a blistering rash on his hands off and on for over 20 years. The man saw the rash as simply annoying, but the diagnosis suggested an important underlying medical problem. Your challenge was to identify both the cause of the rash as well as the underlying diagnosis.
The rash was from: Porphyria cutanea tarda
Which was in turn caused by: Hereditary hemochromatosis
I thought this was a really tough case, but many of you were able to recognize the rash, and some of you figured out the cause as well. Amazing!
The first reader to send us the correct answer was Nick Zampariello, a second-year medical student at Boston University. He tells me he just finished his dermatology block and so was eager to take on a case with a difficult rash. He figured (correctly) that the rash was limited to the patient’s hands because of sun exposure, and then recognized the rash of this type of porphyria. The post-summer tan suggested the underlying cause of hemochromatosis.
About the Diagnosis
The porphyrias are a group of diseases caused by a problem in the breakdown of hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying part of red blood cells. The name comes from the Latin word for purple (porphyros), because with some forms of this disease, the unbroken-down parts of hemoglobin are eliminated from the body in the urine, and those chemicals can make the urine turn purple when exposed to sunlight.",2016-12-09 21:19:21,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,hemochromatosis
561,The DOCTOR'S WORLD; Iron in Diet Is Poison for a Million Americans,"The true nature of some heart problems goes undetected until a serious problem develops. Hospital Practice, a medical journal, recently reported the case of a 46-year-old hospital administrator who developed congestive heart failure and heart rhythm abnormalities. More extensive examination led to the diagnosis of previously undetected hemochromatosis. The heart problems improved after several units of blood were removed, doctors reported.
Although researchers have mapped the genetic defect in hemochromatosis to a site on chromosome No. 6, they have not identified the specific nature of the defect and how it leads to iron overload.
There are several types of hemochromatosis, but the most common is inherited in a well-known pattern called autosomal recessive. The disease results only when an individual inherits a pair of abnormal genes, one from each parent. Carriers, who have one abnormal and one normal gene, do not appear to develop significant iron overload. If two carriers marry, each of their children has a one-in-four chance of inheriting the disorder.
The abnormal hemochromatosis gene has been linked to markers, called HLA antigens, that can be identified in the blood. The markers have been used to detect people who are at high risk of having the disease after the first case is found within a family. But the HLA antigens are not specific enough for hemochromatosis to be used to screen the general population.
Iron is needed to carry oxygen through the blood and in muscles. Iron is absorbed in the first part of the intestine, or duodenum. Normally the intestine limits the absorption of iron in the diet to about one milligram, or 10 percent in the diet, each day. But people with hemochromatosis have a defect in the duodenum that in some unknown way significantly increases the amount of iron absorbed from the diet.
What iron is absorbed is kept for life because the body has no way to get rid of the metal except through menstruation, childbearing and injury. Trivial amounts are lost as old cells die and new ones are formed in the intestine and skin.
In both sexes, the severity of a hereditary illness can vary widely.
Hemochromatosis develops more often in men than women. The prevailing explanation is that women who have hemochromatosis are more likely to escape symptoms and damage because they lose iron in the blood through menstruation and childbirth.",1990-11-27 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,hemochromatosis

563,She Craved Salt and Felt Nauseated for Months. What Was Wrong?,"The waiter had barely put the plate in front of her when the 46-year-old woman felt the color drain from her face. She was in Fresno, Calif., on a work trip and had come to a restaurant to meet an old friend for dinner. But all of a sudden her stomach dropped — the way it might on a roller-coaster ride. A sudden coolness on her face told her she’d broken out in a sweat. She felt dizzy and a little confused. She saw the alarmed face of her friend and knew she looked as bad as she felt. She excused herself and carefully made her way to the bathroom. She sat in front of the vanity and supported her head on her arms. There was the now-familiar stabbing pain in her stomach.
She wasn’t sure how long she stayed like that. Was it 10 minutes? 15? At last she felt as if she could get up. As she hurried to meet her friend at the entrance, she felt the contents of her stomach surging upward. She covered her mouth as vomit shot between her fingers. She lowered her head and bolted through the doorway, trying not to see the horrified faces of the diners.
In the parking lot, the rush of stomach contents continued until she was completely empty. Exhausted, she sank into the seat of her friend’s car. She was too sick to go back to her hotel, her friend said. Instead the friend would take her to her house, until she felt better.

The study, published last week in The Journal of the American Medical Association, looked at people with hemochromatosis, a genetic disorder in which they retain too much iron in their blood. The overabundance of iron can lead to organ damage.
The only treatment is for patients to have their blood drawn regularly. But while the disease cannot be transmitted to other people through blood transfusions, and federal regulations do not forbid blood banks to use the patients' blood, it is often thrown away.
One concern has been that hemochromatosis patients, unlike other donors, may have a motive to lie about carrying blood-borne infections.

565,Race Is Seen as Real Guide To Track Roots of Disease,"Meanwhile a proposal for avoiding racial labels, at least for drug trials, has recently been made by Dr. David Goldstein, a population geneticist at University College, London. He has suggested that patients be assigned to different genetic groups by analyzing their DNA. The process gives much the same result as asking people to identify their ethnicity, but yields a more accurate division in terms of how people respond to drugs, Dr. Goldstein says. He adds that the expense of the genetic testing will be affordable in drug trials.
In asserting that race is a valid concept for medical research, Dr. Risch has plunged into an arena where many fear to tread. He also takes issue with Dr. Goldstein's race-sidestepping proposal, saying it will lead to confusing results.
Race, as Dr. Risch describes it, has arisen because of the numerous small genetic differences that have developed in populations around the world. Many studies, Dr. Risch writes, have shown that these differences cluster into five major groups, which are simply the world's major continental areas.
When modern humans spread out of Africa and across the globe, these early populations bred for many generations in substantial isolation from one another, allowing genetic differences to build up between groups. These five geographically isolated groups, in Dr. Risch's description, are sub-Saharan Africans; Caucasians, including people from Europe, the Indian subcontinent and the Middle East; Asians, including people from China, Japan, the Philippines and Siberia; Pacific Islanders; and Native Americans.
There are also many peoples who are genetic admixtures of the major groups. Somalis and Ethiopians, on the boundary between Caucasians and Africans, are an admixture of the two, Dr. Risch said, as are African-Americans.
Dr. Risch calculates on the basis of existing surveys that testing a person's DNA at 100 random sites along the genome, or at 30 specially chosen ones, would be sufficient to distinguish the major racial groups. It would require tests at some 50 specially chosen sites to distinguish people from different ethnic groups within a race, he said.
The ancestral human population would have contained within it many genetic differences and alternative gene forms inherited from the predecessor species. This shared pool of differences still accounts for 85 percent to 90 percent of those seen in the global human population, according to many measures. The differences between ethnic groups account for the other 10 percent to 15 percent. This well-known analysis, however, is based on commonly occurring versions of genes, and rare versions of genes, when measured, may show a greater tendency to be specific to different populations, Dr. Risch said.",2002-07-30 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,hemochromatosis

568,The Claim: Drinking Tea Can Lower Your Levels of Iron,"THE FACTS
With its bounty of antioxidants and relatively moderate levels of caffeine, tea is one of the healthiest beverages around. But drinking tea is said to block the body’s absorption of dietary iron, potentially causing a deficiency.
Studies have shown that there is some truth to the idea. Compounds in tea called tannins can act as chelators, binding to minerals and inhibiting the body’s ability to absorb them. Although that can reduce a person’s levels of iron, studies have also found that it is unlikely to have much of an impact.

In one study, scientists examined the effect by having people eat a typical meal  a hamburger, string beans and mashed potatoes  and then measuring their iron levels after the meal was combined with various drinks. When the subjects ate the meal with tea, there was a 62 percent reduction in iron absorption. Drinking coffee resulted in a 35 percent reduction. Orange juice increased iron absorption by about 85 percent.",2009-06-29 20:26:22,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,hemochromatosis

Herbert Scheinberg, a specialist in rare hereditary diseases who helped develop a diagnostic test and treatment for Wilson disease, a potentially fatal buildup of copper in the body, died April 4 in Elizabethtown, N.Y. He was 89 and lived in Lewis, N.Y.
The cause was pneumonia, said his son, David.
Dr. Scheinberg devoted most of his career to studying, treating and raising awareness of Wilson disease, which affects about one in 40,000 people. It is a toxic accumulation of dietary copper in the liver, brain and other organs, leading to progressive neurological and behavioral problems and, if untreated, death. It is named after Dr. Samuel A. K. Wilson, who first described it in 1912.
Often, evidence of Wilson disease does not appear until adolescence or young adulthood.

570,Patients Eagerly Awaited a Generic Drug. Then They Saw the Price.,"When Teva Pharmaceuticals announced recently that it would begin selling a copycat version of Syprine — an expensive drug invented in the 1960s — the news seemed like a welcome development for people taking old drugs that have skyrocketed in price.
Syprine, which treats a rare condition known as Wilson disease, gained notoriety after Valeant Pharmaceuticals International raised the price of the drug to $21,267 in 2015 from $652 just five years earlier. Along with similar practices by pharmaceutical executives like Martin Shkreli of Turing Pharmaceuticals and Heather Bresch of Mylan (the maker of the EpiPen), the story helped spark a national conversation about the high cost of prescription drugs, not to mention Congressional inquiries and federal investigations.
In promoting its “lower-cost” alternative to Syprine, a Teva executive boasted in a news release that the product “illustrates Teva’s commitment to serving patient populations in need.”
What the release didn’t mention was the price: Teva’s new generic will cost $18,375 for a bottle of 100 pills, according to Elsevier’s Gold Standard Drug Database.

571,"THE DOCTOR'S WORLD; THE TRAGEDY OF A CONFUSING, RARE DISEASE","Without enough ceruloplasmin, copper slowly collects in the liver and eventually destroys the organ by causing cirrhosis. Meanwhile, the copper-rich liver releases variable amounts of the metal, sometimes rapidly, causing a serious anemia. However, the release is usually gradual. Copper is deposited in the brain, kidneys, eyes and other organs and the damage takes years to develop. The damage to the brain affects motor function and not intelligence.
Wilson's disease occurs throughout the world but is so rare that a physician who cares for three new patients each day is likely to encounter only one case in a 40-year career, according to ''Wilson's Disease,'' a book by Dr. Scheinberg and Dr. Irmin Sternlieb. Still, physicians must always be on the alert for such rare diseases because they never know when one will show up in their practice.
Physicians are taught to listen carefully to what their patients say because they often provide the crucial clues. But many doctors do not follow that advice. Mothers of children with Wilson's disease have pointed out that something was wrong with their children's eyes, only to have the doctor scoff at or ignore the observation. In several instances, a mother has had to take her child to several doctors before the correct diagnosis was made. One child was treated for three years by a psychiatrist without improvement. The mother insisted on a consultation, and an internist immediately diagnosed Wilson's disease.
Another error involved a 19-year- old man who passed his physical for the United States Marines despite hand tremors and slurred speech that developed when he was 11 years old. He was discharged because he could not salute without shaking uncontrollably.
Even doctors have failed to recognize their own symptoms as those of Wilson's disease. One was diagnosed as having chronic viral hepatitis when he was a medical student. The hepatitis continued for several years, and it was only when he developed pinkeye and consulted an ophthalmologist that he learned he also had Kayser-Fleischer rings and Wilson's disease. Once penicillamine treatment started, the ''hepatitis'' cleared.
The disease is named after Dr. Samuel A. K. Wilson, an American- born neurologist working in Britain who first described several cases of the ailment in 1912. He distinguished the disease from multiple sclerosis, with which it had been often confused.
Wilson's disease is a hereditary disorder that is passed on in an autosomal recessive pattern. In order for a case to occur, both parents must be carriers of the Wilson's disease gene. One in every 90 people, or 2.5 million Americans, is such a carrier. However, they do not develop any manifestations of the disease.",1984-01-31 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,wilson disease
572,"Valeant’s Drug Price Strategy Enriches It, but Infuriates Patients and Lawmakers","The threat of government action is making the pharmaceutical industry nervous. A big sell-off in biotechnology stocks over the last two weeks helped wipe out the sector’s gains for the entire year. Valeant’s stock has been among the hardest hit, losing about a quarter of its value since Sept. 18. Still, the stock is trading for about six times as much as it was five years ago, a meteoric rise that far outpaced most drug companies.
Valeant defended itself, saying in a statement that it “prices its treatments based on a range of factors, including clinical benefits and the value they bring to patients, physicians, payers and society.” It says patients are largely shielded from price increases by insurance and financial assistance programs the company offers, so that virtually no one is denied a drug they need.
But Mr. Pearson, a former McKinsey & Company consultant, has said he has a duty to shareholders to wring the maximum profit out of each drug. And in some cases old neglected drugs sell for far less than newer drugs for the same diseases.
If “products are sort of mispriced and there’s an opportunity, we will act appropriately in terms of doing what I assume our shareholders would like us to do,” he told analysts in a conference call in April.
Valeant is an extreme example of practices that have been around in the pharmaceutical industry for years. The United States, unlike most countries, does not control drug prices, and pharmaceutical manufacturers have relied heavily on steady and sometimes outsize price increases in this country to bolster their revenue and profits.
Valeant is known for buying companies and laying off their employees to achieve savings, while accumulating a debt of about $30 billion. It spends an amount equivalent to only 3 percent of its sales on research and development, which it views as risky and inefficient compared with buying existing drugs. Traditional big drug companies spend 15 to 20 percent of sales on research and development.

The teams agreed on what had most likely shut down Jessa’s liver: Wilson’s disease, a genetic disorder that causes the body to accumulate copper, which gradually builds up to toxic levels. The tipping point often occurs when patients are in their teens or 20s. In some, like Jessa, the disease gives no warning signs before the liver suddenly stops working. Jessa’s blood tests suggested Wilson’s, and an eye exam found hints of a telltale ring of copper deposits around the iris.
The family was stunned. Wilson’s disease is rare, affecting one person in 30,000. Jessa’s parents are healthy and had no idea that they carried the disease. No one in either family had ever had it, as far as they knew. The gene is recessive, so people who carry one copy do not develop symptoms. But Jessa inherited two copies, one from each parent. The double dose gave her the disease. Her older sister, tested after Jessa became ill, does not have the disease. The real challenge would be to stabilize Jessa long enough to survive the trans-Atlantic flight. Dr. Steven J. Lobritto, NewYork-Presbyterian’s medical director for pediatric liver transplants, urged Dr. Lalazar and his colleagues to perform plasmapheresis, a procedure that separates blood cells from plasma and lets doctors replace the patient’s plasma. In Wilson’s, removing the plasma can lower the copper level and reverse some of its toxic effects.",2009-08-17 20:07:31,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,wilson disease
575,The Wilderness of Rare Genetic Diseases and the Parents Navigating It,"A confirmed diagnosis may take time.
Diagnosis represents the first step on this rare disease journey. Sometimes doctors will notice something off about the child during a newborn screening, and a genetic test will identify a known mutation in the DNA. But not all conditions are so quickly detected, and it can take several years for parents to get a confirmed diagnosis.
About half of all children never get that far, according to Marshall Summar, M.D., the director of the Rare Disease Institute at Children’s National Hospital in Washington, D.C. “When you sequence someone’s DNA, you are going to find a lot of changes,” Dr. Summar said. “Figuring out which change might be the one that is causing it is a tremendous challenge.”
Genetic counselors warn parents beforehand that they may not get a definitive answer as to what condition their child could have. They may have to check back each year. Dr. Summar estimates that between five and 10 new rare diseases are described in the scientific literature every week, making it challenging for the medical field to keep up.
Meanwhile, the realization that a child may have a debilitating, lifelong condition weighs heavily. “Some parents, particularly mothers, blame themselves,” said Lemuel Pelentsov, Ph.D., a nurse who studies the needs of rare disease families at the University of South Australia, in Adelaide. In a 2016 study by Dr. Pelentsov and his colleagues, about 40 percent of the 300 rare parents surveyed reported being treated for depression and an equal number for anxiety. “One of the things they do to combat that,” he said, “is get very invested in the child’s disease.”
Families will find support in each other.
When parents reach out to other parents, they are not simply looking for emotional support or advice. They are rebuilding a social life, one that will revolve around their child’s disease. Many rare diseases have their own support groups. Global Genes is an umbrella group that supports 600 disease-specific foundations, as well as parents of children whose diseases are so rare they have no foundation.
“We encourage folks to work together,” said Kimberly Haugstad, the organization’s executive director whose son has a rare form of hemophilia, a condition in which the blood doesn’t clot normally. “The parent is going to come from such different places in their own walk of life.”
Some parents will start nonprofits or fund research.
Each year, Global Genes hosts a “Rare Boot Camp” to mentor and teach parents how to set up a nonprofit, create patient registries and fund research. After attending the boot camp, the Van Wyks and other parents founded GACI Global, an organization that connects families affected by GACI, along with medical professionals.",2020-07-07 09:00:16,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,wilson disease
576,"A Minister Says His Father, Now Dead, Killed Dr. King","Saying he could no longer keep his dead father's secret, a minister is contending that his father -- not James Earl Ray -- fatally shot the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. at a Memphis motel in 1968.
The man, the Rev. Ronald Denton Wilson, said in an interview today that his father, Henry Clay Wilson, led a group of three conspirators responsible for Dr. King's death.
''My father was the main guy,'' said Mr. Wilson, 61, of Keystone Heights, north of Gainesville. ''It wasn't a racist thing. He thought Martin Luther King was connected with communism, and he wanted to get him out of the way.''
Mr. Wilson produced no evidence to support his claim.
Mr. Wilson, a pastor at the nondenominational New Covenant Church in Graham, north of Gainesville, said his father died in 1990 of complications from emphysema.

Recently, we tried something different: posting a tough-to-diagnose case on The New York Times Well blog and challenging readers to try to figure out what was wrong with the patient. More than 1,300 people responded with a lively combination of questions and answers. Now, you can try to crack the case and follow the crowd-sourced medical conversation.
SYMPTOMS
A healthy 10-year-old girl told her mother that she was losing a lot of hair when she showered. Her mother didn’t give it much thought, until one morning when she saw for herself how much hair remained on her hands after making a ponytail for her daughter. Looking at her child’s head in the sunlight later that morning, the mother thought that maybe her hair was thinning. She took her to see Dr. Kathryn Italia, their pediatrician in Exton, a suburb of Philadelphia, that afternoon.
THE EXAM
Although the child seemed well, the doctor was concerned. The girl’s mother, who had two other children, was not a big worrier. There were no other symptoms, but the mother reported that her daughter might have been a little more tired lately. Italia examined the child but found nothing unusual.
Possible Diagnoses
Thyroid disease: Can cause hair loss and fatigue. Lupus and other immune-system diseases: Can also cause hair loss. Metabolic disease: Can disrupt any of the multiple processes the body uses to get energy from food. Testing of blood, kidneys and liver will often reveal its presence.",2011-04-08 12:00:30,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,wilson disease

Sir John's principal vehicle was Sight Savers International, which he originally called the Royal Commonwealth Society for the Blind. Since the early 1980's, he had expanded his personal crusade to help people with all types of disabilities. His work extended from Africa to India to the Caribbean.
In the 1950's, in West Africa, Sir John organized a worldwide campaign against a sight-destroying illness he called ''river blindness,'' virtually eradicating the insect-borne scourge.
In the 1960's, he set up teams of surgeons in India to perform more than 200,000 cataract operations a year.

Medicare is expected to spend $10 million for the operations in the first year and $120 million by the fifth year, as more hospitals gain approval for reimbursement under the liver transplant program.
But Dr. Sulliivan said the net impact on the Medicare budget would be lower because the transplants would save the costs of treating patients with advanced liver disease. He did not estimate the expected savings.
Under the proposed rule, Medicare payment would allowed for transplants in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, hepatitis B, antigen negative or postnecrotic cirrhosis, alcoholic cirrhosis, Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency disease, Wilson's disease and primary hemochromatosis.",1990-03-10 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,primary biliary cholangitis

He was 58.
His wife, Kyle Redford, said the cause was cancer of the bile ducts.
Mr. Redford had primary sclerosing cholangitis, a disease that affects the bile ducts and damages the liver. He had a liver transplant in March 1993 and later that year, after the first liver failed, underwent a second transplant.
The experience led him to found the James Redford Institute for Transplant Awareness, which sought to increase knowledge about organ donation and other aspects of transplantation, primarily through filmmaking.
“I’m still amazed at how many wrong ideas people have,” Mr. Redford, widely known as Jamie, told The Omaha World Herald in 1996, explaining his motivation. “I’m amazed at how many think you can’t have a normal funeral after you donate organs, or that if you are a good Christian or follow the Jewish faith you can’t donate organs.”",2020-10-22 16:41:10,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,primary biliary cholangitis

He was 45.
The cause was bile duct cancer, said Dr. Greg Gores, Payton's physician at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.
On Feb. 2, during an emotional news conference in Chicago, Payton disclosed that he had primary sclerosing cholangitis, a rare condition in which the bile ducts are blocked. He said doctors had told him he would need a liver transplant within two years. A week later, after further tests, doctors told him he needed a transplant by the end of 1999. He was said to have been on a waiting list with 12,000 others at the Mayo Clinic. Dr. Gores said yesterday that Payton had received chemotherapy and radiation treatment after the cancer was diagnosed but it had progressed to where ''transplantation was no longer a viable option.''
The fact that Payton had cancer was not made public before his death.
Playing from 1975 through 1987 for the Bears, who endured many mediocre seasons before becoming winners, he set a host of National Football League records. He retired with career marks for rushing yards (16,726) and attempts (3,838), combined yards (21,803 rushing, receiving and returning), 100-yard rushing games (77) and 1,000-yard rushing seasons (10).

582,"Sheila Sherlock, 83, Expert on Liver Disease","''When she started, it was unimaginably difficult for a woman to advance in medicine,'' said Dr. Eugene Schiff, former president of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases. ''But she became a renowned doctor and wrote heavily on liver disease. Her books were very popular because, in the beginning, she was the only author on the subject and loaded them with concise and easy to read information.''
In 1959, she became the first woman to be promoted to a professorship of medicine at the Royal Free Hospital in London, where she helped set up and direct a world famous clinical, research and training center on liver disease.
One of the first of its kind, it gained an international reputation, and doctors from all over the world traveled there to study the disorders of the liver, the body's largest organ, Dr. Schiff said.
Dr. Jay H. Lefkowitch of the department of pathology at Columbia University added, ''Most of the liver world spent some time in her liver unit at the Royal Free Hospital in London, or wished they had.''
In World War II, many doctors were puzzled by jaundice, a liver disorder afflicting many Allied troops. Dr. Sherlock helped improve understanding of the condition when she began using liver biopsies -- previously just a research tool -- to diagnose the condition. The method helped shed light on the causes of the disorder and is used today for investigating liver disease.",2002-01-10 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,primary biliary cholangitis
583,"Gone, but far from forgotten","LeDoux never became a stadium-size star, as Brooks did. With his boyish enthusiasm and fondness for melodramatic - and quite often riveting - stories, Brooks is a great narrator, while LeDoux was more like a protagonist. His voice is rougher and less precise, and, when he sang about the rodeo, fans knew that he was a 1976 bareback riding champion.
When Brooks sings about LeDoux, you can hear not just affection but also awe. Borrowing words and phrases from LeDoux's huge oeuvre and confident that true LeDoux fans will recognize every one, Brooks turns an old friend into a new hero:
From ""Bareback Jack"" to ""This Cowboy's Hat""
The songs were stronger than his pain
He would not ""Slow Down"" from town to town
Like children ""Running Through the Rain.""
That reference to pain is an indirect acknowledgment of the illness that took LeDoux's life. He had a rare disorder called primary sclerosing cholangitis and eventually died from cancer of the bile duct. You won't find any mention of that in the song, and not just because those words would ruin the meter. When a singer dies too young, fans can't help imagining that the end somehow reflects all that came before. And so if ""Good Ride Cowboy"" helps some listeners to imagine that LeDoux met his fate in some rodeo disaster, after riding one too many horses and testing his luck one too many times - well, so much the better.
When it comes to conflating life with death, few artists pose more temptations than Biggie. He released only one album during his lifetime, and it was called ""Ready to Die."" He was shot just before his second album reached shops; in a horrible coincidence, it was called ""Life After Death.""
The duet with Marley is part of ""The Final Chapter,"" a duets album being prepared by Biggie's friend and mentor, Sean (Diddy) Combs. For the album, Diddy has recruited a lot of hip-hop A-listers, including R. Kelly, Jay-Z and Eminem. Unlike Tupac Shakur, who somehow remains one of hip-hop's most prolific acts, Biggie has released only one posthumous album, an ill-conceived 1999 compilation also overseen by Diddy.

585,3 New York Students Win Westinghouse Science Awards,"Ms. Lin plans to attend Harvard next year.
The sixth-place winner is from a powerhouse of the Westinghouse awards -- the Bronx High School of Science. The student, Flora Tartakovsky, 17, of Forest Hills, Queens, won a $15,000 scholarship for her experiment on early detection of primary biliary cirrhosis, an inflammatory disease of the liver. Ms. Tartakovsky, who was born in Ukraine, volunteers in a doctor's office to get a first-hand look at life as a physician. She submitted a paper on her project to a medical journal for publication, and a biotechnology firm has signed a confidentiality release to obtain information from it.
""This is better than winning Miss America for me,' she said. ""The judging is a little grueling and the people here are so bright, I never dreamed of winning.""
Jamel Lamonte Oeser-Sweat, 17, of Martin Luther King Jr. High School, placed 10th for his work involving pathogenic bacteria on bathing accessories used in hospitals, like luffa sponges and pumice stones. Working in a program for high school students at Mount Sinai Medical Center, he showed these accessories caused skin lesions if not disinfected regularly.
""I didn't really care if I won or not,"" he said. ""Now it's time to go off to college.""
Mr. Oeser-Sweat, who lives in a housing project on the Lower East Side, had many obstacles to overcome on his way to a Westinghouse award and a $10,000 scholarship, and his determination to succeed in school has brought national attention. His father died of cancer when he was 5, and he spent part of his childhood in the Prince George Hotel, a homeless shelter. He was placed in foster care five years ago when his mother was hospitalized with a chronic psychological illness.

586,Promising Drug Trial Lifts Stock of Intercept,"Very little data was provided, other than how statistically significant the results were. Patients had liver biopsies at the start of the study and after completion of treatment 72 weeks later. The main measure in the trial was how many patients had a two-point decline in an index of disease severity along with no worsening of fibrosis, or scarring.
Dr. Pruzanski of Intercept, which is based in Lower Manhattan, said the company would wait to get the results and then hoped to meet with the Food and Drug Administration to discuss the next steps. It is likely that another trial will be needed to confirm the results.
The F.D.A. has not yet said what the goals of a clinical trial should be, though it held a meeting with experts on this subject in September.
Ideally a trial would show that a drug reduces the risk of cirrhosis and liver failure, but such a study would take many, many years. So experts hope the agency will accept other measures, such as those based on biopsies.
Intercept hopes to win approval by the end of 2015 for use of obeticholic acid to treat a rarer liver disease, primary biliary cirrhosis. Such approval would make the drug available for off-label use to treat NASH, though insurers might not pay for that use.
Analysts said the market for the drug could be huge. “NASH is possibly one of the few remaining large untapped markets that we could compare to the LDL or diabetes market and is rapidly growing,” Jonathan Eckard, an analyst with Citigroup, wrote in a note on Thursday, referring to the high cholesterol.
Other companies, including the biotech giant Gilead Sciences and tiny Galectin Therapeutics, are also developing drugs for the disease.",2014-01-10 02:56:53,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,primary biliary cholangitis
587,Breeders’ Cup: Flat Out and Trainer Dickey a Longshot Story,"Flat Out started the season with a relatively modest runner-up finish in the Grade 3 Lone Star Park Handicap this May. He ran sixth in the Grade 1 Stephen Foster Handicap at 18-1 at Churchill in June, and was dismissed at 13-1 when Dickey wheeled him around to the Grade 2 Suburban Handicap at Belmont Park just 22 days later.
But in that race, something clicked. Rolling to a six-and-a half-length win, Flat Out began a stakes campaign that, before the Gold Cup, resulted in two seconds to two of the nation’s best horses in Grade 1 races: the now-retired Tizway in the Whitney Invitational Handicap and the 4-year-old filly Havre de Grace in the Woodward Stakes at Saratoga.
“It’s a beautiful story,” Preston said. “It’s fantastic for this horse to have come through all these ordeals and to have him in the best condition he’s ever been in, peaking at exactly the right time. A large part of that is thanks to Scooter. He has tremendous experience and the time to give to this particular horse, who needs a lot of T.L.C.”
For Flat Out’s current physical condition, “the best he’s ever been,” Dickey also credits a farrier, Tom Wildy, who corrected the horse’s fragile hooves, along with his assistant trainer Walter Aguilar and his groom Mario Quinteros.
“They stuck with me, that was the main part,” Dickey said. “Everybody’s been real patient; there’s been a lot of people taking care of this horse to keep him going.”
Breeders’ Cup week has been slightly surreal for Dickey, a native of Anthony, Kan. (population 2,200), whose biggest victory before Flat Out came along was a $100,000 state-bred event at Louisiana Downs. Dickey finished sixth to Gate Dancer in the 1984 Preakness Stakes with a horse named Wind Flyer, but he never had one like Flat Out. Unusual in an era of megastables, his string of runners rarely swells beyond 8 to 10. Although he is enjoying the big leagues, he is not sleeping as well as he usually does.
“He’s really focused on what is best for the horse,” said Dana, who is 65 and on a transplant list because she has an incurable liver disease called primary biliary cirrhosis. “We’ve been married for 48 years, and it’s been a lot of ups and downs throughout, but we always persevered and we’re really happy. This horse is like family to us.”",2011-11-02 00:04:16,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,primary biliary cholangitis
588,"They're Pop Immortals, Whether Dead or Alive","Have you heard the new Chris LeDoux hit single? Of course, it's not a new song by LeDoux, the beloved rodeo star turned country star who died in March. It's a new song about him, recorded by his friend Garth Brooks. It's called ""Good Ride Cowboy,"" and it's a high-spirited send-off. The eulogy culminates with a celebratory reference to that famous goddess of victory and sneakers: ""Be more like Chris/Pull your hat down tight and just LeDoux it!""
While ""Good Ride Cowboy"" canters up the country charts, the hip-hop world is getting acquainted with a different kind of tribute song: an ode to the Notorious B.I.G., more often known as Biggie, who was killed in 1997. Since this is hip-hop, it's fitting that the homage is delivered by the rapper himself, with lyrics recycled from an old recording. And the new song is ""Hold Ya Head,"" a stitched-together collaboration with Bob Marley, and it reminds listeners of B.I.G.'s grim sense of humor. It begins with his famous declaration that when he dies, ""I wanna go to hell.""
Like Buddhist monks and soap opera villains, pop stars know that death isn't the end. While the pop marketplace often demands constant transformation from its living stars, it has also found ways to reward the immutability of the ones who will forever remain tragically young or laudably old. The departed stay fixed firmly in place, sometimes seeming sturdier than the flighty singers and rappers who can't afford to stay the same. And so when the living and the dead collaborate, each borrows a little immortality from the other. That's the idea when Peggy Lee and Tupac Shakur are reincarnated as a Bette Midler tribute album and a CD of hip-hop poetry. (You can guess which became which, although it would be more fun if you couldn't.)
""Good Ride Cowboy"" borrows some of its power from a story that country fans already know: the two singers were famous friends, and their careers have been intertwined. Mr. Brooks helped push LeDoux into the mainstream when he sang, on his 1989 debut album, about a ""worn-out tape of Chris LeDoux""; a few years later, the two collaborated on a hit single, ""Whatcha Gonna Do With a Cowboy?""",2005-10-27 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,primary biliary cholangitis

591,What Do I Owe My Sociopathic Sibling?,"In a society with a serious commitment to reintegrating released offenders, as in much of Western Europe, you could leave it to government institutions to see that your sibling got a chance to spend the rest of his or her life with basic needs met. Your sibling’s prospects are probably worse here in the United States. Still, there are organizations that aim to help ex-prisoners with life on the outside, and your sibling has as good a shot as most at being able to take advantage of them.
Everyone has reason to hope that those who have, as we say, paid their debt to society will be reintegrated. The fact that this person is your sibling gives you a special, personal reason to hope he or she will be able to work his or her way back into society. But you are not obliged to put your own resources into that effort, and you could reasonably leave your sibling to fend for him- or herself. You haven’t had and don’t want a relationship. After all these years, maintaining this remove is your right.
But what if your sibling asked for help? That you recognize there is some prima facie claim on you means you would owe it to him or her to meet and discuss the situation. It would then be your sibling’s job to persuade you that more is deserved. And if it were your educated belief that your sibling remained unreformed, you’d have reason to make it plain that, family ties aside, your sibling has lost the right to your assistance.
I am a professional who has experienced severe job dissatisfaction over the last few years, trying out a few positions only to find myself disappointed. This year, I finally found a job that is a good fit. However, I have recently become suspicious that the boss is billing for services not provided. Can I ethically stay at this job? The suspicion alone has put a damper on my enthusiasm, and I am keeping an eye open for other opportunities, but should I speed up my departure? If I find proof of fraud, does that mean I absolutely cannot stay? Name Withheld
Pulling out of your job because your boss is corrupt does little more than keep your own reputation free of taint by association. The real problem isn’t that you may be indirectly associated with wrongdoing; the real problem is that wrongdoing may be going on. If you ever have sufficient evidence to establish this, you could send it to the relevant authorities and try to prompt an investigation, or you could alert the victims. When all you have are suspicions, though, abandoning a job you like in a world where those are hard to come by imposes costs on you without improving the overall situation. The best reason for your decision to keep your eyes open for other opportunities is that you might be happier elsewhere.

That's what it came down to for Chris Klug - liver transplant survivor, World Cup contender - during his giant slalom race today for a bronze medal against Nicolas Huet of France. He could feel the loosening of the red plastic boot, the slight loss of control.
He rode the lift back to the top of the slope for the second and final run, calling around desperately for a technician. One of his friends pulled out screwdrivers, metal slivers the size of paper clips, anything he could find in his pockets. With 30 seconds to go before the start of the race, they managed to rig something together with duct tape and a piece of metal.
The makeshift buckle was shaky, but Klug suddenly realized - as he had so many times in the last two years - that some things were beyond his control, that in the end life was a game of chance.

When Brooks sings about LeDoux, you can hear not just affection but also awe. Borrowing words and phrases from LeDoux's huge oeuvre and confident that true LeDoux fans will recognize every one, Brooks turns an old friend into a new hero:
From ""Bareback Jack"" to ""This Cowboy's Hat""
The songs were stronger than his pain
He would not ""Slow Down"" from town to town
Like children ""Running Through the Rain.""
That reference to pain is an indirect acknowledgment of the illness that took LeDoux's life. He had a rare disorder called primary sclerosing cholangitis and eventually died from cancer of the bile duct. You won't find any mention of that in the song, and not just because those words would ruin the meter. When a singer dies too young, fans can't help imagining that the end somehow reflects all that came before. And so if ""Good Ride Cowboy"" helps some listeners to imagine that LeDoux met his fate in some rodeo disaster, after riding one too many horses and testing his luck one too many times - well, so much the better.
When it comes to conflating life with death, few artists pose more temptations than Biggie. He released only one album during his lifetime, and it was called ""Ready to Die."" He was shot just before his second album reached shops; in a horrible coincidence, it was called ""Life After Death.""
The duet with Marley is part of ""The Final Chapter,"" a duets album being prepared by Biggie's friend and mentor, Sean (Diddy) Combs. For the album, Diddy has recruited a lot of hip-hop A-listers, including R. Kelly, Jay-Z and Eminem. Unlike Tupac Shakur, who somehow remains one of hip-hop's most prolific acts, Biggie has released only one posthumous album, an ill-conceived 1999 compilation also overseen by Diddy. This CD is Diddy's chance to get it right.",2005-11-08 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,primary sclerosing cholangitis
594,Medicare to Cover Some Liver Transplants,"The Government will begin paying for certain liver transplants in Medicare beneficiaries, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, announced Thursday.
Medicare is expected to spend $10 million for the operations in the first year and $120 million by the fifth year, as more hospitals gain approval for reimbursement under the liver transplant program.
But Dr. Sulliivan said the net impact on the Medicare budget would be lower because the transplants would save the costs of treating patients with advanced liver disease. He did not estimate the expected savings.
Under the proposed rule, Medicare payment would allowed for transplants in patients with primary biliary cirrhosis, primary sclerosing cholangitis, hepatitis B, antigen negative or postnecrotic cirrhosis, alcoholic cirrhosis, Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency disease, Wilson's disease and primary hemochromatosis.",1990-03-10 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,primary sclerosing cholangitis
595,Making the hard decision to forgo emergency measures,"Saltsman, who tries to raise the subject of DNR orders for all his elderly patients, said families ignore them at considerable risk. For the elderly and very sick, aggressive CPR often breaks fragile bones, and causes internal bleeding.
One national study found that less than 5 percent of chronically ill elderly patients revived by CPR live long enough to be discharged from the hospital, and the fraction that survive are a far weaker version of themselves, often neurologically impaired.
""There is a strong likelihood they are not the same person as they were before,"" Saltsman said.
For Batson, it was the image of her frail mother being revived and connected to a breathing machine without being able to speak that caused her to dwell on a signed DNR order. She and her brother were committed to having their mother spend her final months in her home, not a nursing home.
They had to make sure their mother's wish to die without CPR would be honored under all circumstances, including if an EMT arrived in her Chelmsford apartment.
When autumn came, Batson had come to the dreaded realization that she - as healthcare proxy - might be the one to have to sign the order. Her mother's mind was clearly declining precipitously, especially after a brief hospitalization in July for chest pains. By late summer, Batson was living full time with her mother, chasing away fictitious cats that her mother claimed were roaming the apartment. Batson also had put up ""No Children Allowed"" signs outside the bedroom door, playing along after her mother complained that children were hiding under her bed.
Batson regretted that she had not pulled the DNR form out of the drawer, pushed away her fears, and talked directly with her mother about the document. Her mother had not raised the topic either, and at times Batson wondered whether her silence had some kind of meaning. But then she would remember that when her father was dying, her mother had been clear that she wanted to go peacefully. So Batson said nothing, wanting her mother's dwindling days to focus on happier times.
She often flashed back to the mother of her past. Married to Edward Russell, the Tennessee native raised two children in Lexington while working full time as a lab technician. A slender woman with brown hair, she was a talented seamstress who tended the garden with her husband. She was at a loss when her husband of 61 years died in 2005, though she stayed busy keeping up with the lives of her two grown children, three grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.",2007-11-04 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,primary sclerosing cholangitis
596,"OLYMPICS: SNOWBOARDING; Defying the Odds Again, Klug Grabs the Bronze","A buckle on his rear boot snapped off. That was what it came down to for Chris Klug -- liver-transplant survivor, World Cup snowboarding contender -- during his parallel giant slalom race today for a bronze medal against Nicolas Huet of France. Klug could feel the loosening of the red plastic boot, the slight loss of control.
He rode the lift back to the top of the slope for the second and final run, calling around desperately for a technician. One of his friends pulled out screwdrivers, metal slivers the size of paper clips, anything he could find in his pockets. With 30 seconds to go before the start of the race, they managed to rig something together with duct tape and a piece of metal.
The makeshift buckle was shaky, but Klug suddenly realized -- as he had so many times in the last two years -- that some things were beyond his control, that in the end life was a game of chance.
''I've faced worse odds before,'' said Klug, 29, of Aspen, Colo. ''If this is meant to happen, it will. If it's not, it won't.''",2002-02-16 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,primary sclerosing cholangitis
597,OLYMPICS; American Snowboarder Uses Podium as Platform,"The identities of donors are kept anonymous. But this much is known: In July 2000, a teenage boy and his friend were playing with a gun when it went off. The way the Klug family understands it, that teenage boy touched a dozen lives the day he died.
His heart was transplanted into one person, and the rest of his organs were harvested for others, including the liver that became a miracle gift for Klug.
''I don't know how much longer I could have gone,'' Klug said.
Seven weeks after the six-hour surgery, a day before a snowboard camp began, Klug stood alone atop a glacier on Mount Hood, with all of Oregon down below. He was transfixed by the sunlight, the snow and a sky as blue as a pilot light. A moment later, he was soaking in the cool rush of air as he glided down on his snowboard for the first time since his transplant.
''I was so grateful,'' Klug said. ''I was just enjoying a perfect day.''
A season after Klug amazed everyone by finishing on the World Cup podium three times last winter, he is back, barreling down mountains in an effort to seal another spot on the United States snowboard team.
With the Winter Games less than 50 days away, NBC has already latched onto Klug's charisma, good looks and Sega-generation appeal. In video-game style, Klug jumps, spins and races ahead of his pursuers in a promotional spot for the Salt Lake Games.
The fame is a kick for Klug. Instead of recoiling, he is flattered by the attention. He keeps his fans updated on his Web site (www.Chris Klug.com). In his snowboard lingo -- describing great training sessions as sick runs -- Klug also answers e-mail messages from his followers.
On occasion, he fields a question from someone facing a transplant. Klug understands what comfort means. When he needed support, he turned to Sean Elliott, a former San Antonio Spurs forward who played through the 1999 N.B.A. finals knowing he needed a kidney transplant that summer. Seven months after his surgery, Elliott was back in a Spurs uniform.",2001-12-25 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,primary sclerosing cholangitis
598,"They're Pop Immortals, Whether Dead or Alive","Have you heard the new Chris LeDoux hit single? Of course, it's not a new song by LeDoux, the beloved rodeo star turned country star who died in March. It's a new song about him, recorded by his friend Garth Brooks. It's called ""Good Ride Cowboy,"" and it's a high-spirited send-off. The eulogy culminates with a celebratory reference to that famous goddess of victory and sneakers: ""Be more like Chris/Pull your hat down tight and just LeDoux it!""
While ""Good Ride Cowboy"" canters up the country charts, the hip-hop world is getting acquainted with a different kind of tribute song: an ode to the Notorious B.I.G., more often known as Biggie, who was killed in 1997. Since this is hip-hop, it's fitting that the homage is delivered by the rapper himself, with lyrics recycled from an old recording. And the new song is ""Hold Ya Head,"" a stitched-together collaboration with Bob Marley, and it reminds listeners of B.I.G.'s grim sense of humor. It begins with his famous declaration that when he dies, ""I wanna go to hell.""
Like Buddhist monks and soap opera villains, pop stars know that death isn't the end. While the pop marketplace often demands constant transformation from its living stars, it has also found ways to reward the immutability of the ones who will forever remain tragically young or laudably old. The departed stay fixed firmly in place, sometimes seeming sturdier than the flighty singers and rappers who can't afford to stay the same. And so when the living and the dead collaborate, each borrows a little immortality from the other. That's the idea when Peggy Lee and Tupac Shakur are reincarnated as a Bette Midler tribute album and a CD of hip-hop poetry. (You can guess which became which, although it would be more fun if you couldn't.)
""Good Ride Cowboy"" borrows some of its power from a story that country fans already know: the two singers were famous friends, and their careers have been intertwined. Mr. Brooks helped push LeDoux into the mainstream when he sang, on his 1989 debut album, about a ""worn-out tape of Chris LeDoux""; a few years later, the two collaborated on a hit single, ""Whatcha Gonna Do With a Cowboy?""",2005-10-27 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,primary sclerosing cholangitis
599,The New York Times,"A 6‐year‐old girl from Port Chester. N.Y., who was admitted to a New York City hospital this week has been reported to Westchester County health officials as possibly having Reye's syndrome.
If she does, the child would be the fifth case of the rare disease in the county this year.
Last month, four Westchester youngsters came down with Reye's syndrome. Three of them died, and one recovered completely. In addition, two southern Connecticut youths, a 9‐yearold Brookfield boy and a 15‐year‐old Southington boy, have come down with the disease.
Reye's syndrome symptoms include frequent vomiting and can lead to a coma, It usually occurs in children and teen‐agers who have suffered from a respiratory ailment.",1977-03-05 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,reye syndrome
600,REYE'S SYNDROME SEEN OUTSIDE CITY LIMITS,"Since the noncontagious Reye's syndrome was identified in the United States in the mid-1960's, thousands of Americans under the age of 18 have contracted it. A quarter of them have died, according to the national Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.
The afflicted children had already been hospitalized by the time Dr. Ruben and his colleagues contacted their parents. Thirty-six died.
Equal numbers of boys and girls contracted the disease, but there were no black patients, Dr. Ruben said. ''There are few blacks in the rural areas and suburbs here,'' he said. Some researchers, such as Dr. Brian Andresen, director of the National Reye's Syndrome Foundation Research Laboratory at Ohio State University, believe the disease is triggered by ''some sort of sniffles, cold, flu or chicken pox.''
As a result, the disease occurs more frequently in the colder months, when viruses are more rampant and children are in school, Dr. Andresen said.
Dr. Ruben, who visited 32 western Pennsylvania families that had Reye's syndrome children from 1973 to 1975, said he, too, found flu to be the only common factor among victims. But a flu epidemic does not necessarily initiate a Reye's syndrome outbreak, he said.",1983-09-06 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,reye syndrome
601,RECOGNIZING THE SYMPTOMS OF REYE'S SYNDROME,"To the Editor:
I would like to correct some information about Reye's Syndrome in the June 5 news story ''Warning Issued on Giving Aspirin to Children.''
Reye's Syndrome occurs as an unusual aftermath of influenza and chicken pox, and affects children from infancy to 19 years of age.
It is not characterized, as the article asserts, by onset of fever and headaches.
It is characterized by powerful (projectile) vomiting, lethargy, confusion and, later, irritability, aggressiveness and altered personality. After this stage, the disease may progress rapidly, as described correctly in The Times, to convulsions, coma and death.
The disease can be managed, with a 90 percent recovery rate, if recognized and treated in the early stages. Late recognition and treatment result in only a 15 percent recovery rate.",1982-06-19 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,reye syndrome
602,STUDY REPORTED TO TIGHTEN LINK OF ASPIRIN AND REYE'S SYNDROME,"Results of a pilot study by the Centers for Disease Control indicate that aspirin given to children suffering from chicken pox or flu increases the risk that they will contract Reye's syndrome, a potentially fatal ailment.
The syndrome can include vomiting, fever, convulsions and comas.
The study found that young victims of chicken pox or flu who were given aspirin were 12 to 26 times more likely to develop Reye's syndrome than those young victims of the diseases who were not treated with aspirin. The differing degrees of risk depended on what statistical risk model was used for the calculations.
Dr. Sidney M. Wolfe, director of Ralph Nader's Health Research Group, who released data from the previously unpublished Government study today, said that the best statistical model indicated that aspirin raised the risk by 25 times. He said that ''this extraordinarily high risk ratio'' was ''much higher than seen in any previous study on aspirin and Reye's'' and ''one of the largest risk ratios found in any recent epidemiological study.''
Findings Considered Strong
Although the new study was a pilot study designed to test the feasibility of a larger-scale study, its findings were considered so strong that the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences has recommended that the results be published, Government sources said today. The institute is a private organization that advises the Government on health issues.",1985-01-09 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,reye syndrome

National news is on pages A11, 18-23 and D15-16.
earlier this year sent the Office of Management and Budget a proposed regulation requiring warning lables, said in a statement that more studies were necessary on the reported link between aspirin and the rare but life-threatening disease that most often occurs in children under 16 years of age with flu or chicken pox.
He told the Public Health Service to make recommendations to him on new research. The aspirin industry said Wednesday it would file suit unless the Government backed off the plan to require the labels next winter. There is a dispute in the scientific community over whether or not evidence is strong enough to prove a link between aspirin and the disease.",1982-11-19 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,reye syndrome

Dr. David Nelson, a medical investigator with the viral diseases division of the national Center for Disease Control here, said the Reye syndrome cases had followed the pattern of the flu outbreaks around the country.
“Clearly there seems to be, at least in time and place, an association with A-influenza,” Dr. Nelson said yesterday.
The development has touched off an investigation by the center, which is trying to establish if there is a medical connection between the regional epidemics of Russian influenza, an A‐type flu, and the Reye syndrome cases.",1979-02-23 05:00:00,en,usa,https://www.nytimes.com/,reye syndrome

       "               'entry': \"I'm looking for advice on controlling the build up of thick mucous in the back of my throat, too far back to be reached with a suction wand.I'm unable to clear the mucous by coughing because of my limited lung capacity. The mucous partially blocks my airway, wakes from sleep every 15 minutes or so, and then I spend another 15 minutes working to clear enough of it to go back to sleep. Then the cycle starts all over.I'm taking glyopyrolate for saliva inhibition, but it doesn't seem to be very effective. I recently started taking drops of Atropine Sulphate orally before bed. The verdict is still out on this treatment.I am 100% tube fed because of my swallowing issues, which may exacerbate the problem because I can't wash down the mucous with liquids through my mouth.I think dehydration may have been a contributing factor to making the mucous thick and adherent, so I'm increasing water intake.Any other suggestions for caging the mucous monster?\"},\n",
